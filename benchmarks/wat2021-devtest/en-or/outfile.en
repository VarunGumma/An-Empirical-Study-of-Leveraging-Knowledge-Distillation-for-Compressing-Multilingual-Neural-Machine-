The reality is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir.

The exams that you are going to take are the exams that you have read every year.
This is not a test of your life.

But that does not mean that I am saying that there is no need to study.
But the things that you have prepared, apart from what you have done, if you get tested, you will suddenly fall down.
But if you keep knowledge at the centre, you are trying to assimilate many things into yourself.
This is a big psychological battle.
Parents play a vital role in the child development, he added.

Proceed with this mantra.

It was difficult to see the pain of the affected people.
