Go ahead with this mantra.

It was difficult to see the pain of the affected people.
But I was inspired by their courage, disaster relief and talent.
The more we trust the leadership of the people from my own experience, the better it will be.

Post a disaster, people affected by disasters use social media to help each other.
Specific action plans will be prepared and implemented at the local level.
For example, if the local fire service officers had visited a school once every week, they could have made thousands of students aware within a year.
And in the end, we have to bring more unity in international response to disasters.
After the disaster is over, we will respond to disasters all over the world.
Our efforts are to build an anti-disaster, we are standing shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region.
Regional and international cooperation has an important role to play in advancing our efforts.
