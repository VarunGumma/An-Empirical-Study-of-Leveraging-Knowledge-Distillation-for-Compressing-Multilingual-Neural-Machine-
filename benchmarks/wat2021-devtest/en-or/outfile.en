In the last 20 years, more than 850,000 people have lost their lives in disasters in the Asia-Pacific region.
Seven out of the top 10 countries in the world have died due to the Asia-Pacific disaster.
It was difficult to see the pain of the affected people.
But I was inspired by their courage, their resilience and talent.
The more we trust the leadership of the people from my own experience, the better it will be.
We therefore need to support such efforts and leadership through policy and action.
After the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, five worst affected countries brought in new laws for disaster management.
A few days later, we will celebrate our first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
This has also been done in the area of pre-cyclone warning.
If we assess the impact of 1999 and 2013 cyclones in India, we will know the development we have done.
It is now recognized as the best international practice.
There will be many challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this development both for planning and implementation, the damage to humans and the economy during disasters will be higher than before.
In this context, I would like to underline our 10-point agenda for disaster mitigation.
First of all, all development sectors will certainly meet the Disaster Management Policy.
Most of the new infrastructure in the world will come to our region in the next few decades.
We will ensure the best disaster safety standards available during its construction.
India will work with other partner countries and partners to promote disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
Now the insurance of most of the countries in the region is only meant for the middle and upper middle income group.

Fourth, investment in disaster maps globally.
We have adopted the standards and standards of disaster maps such as earthquakes in a big way.
By joining this network, universities will be able to carry out special multidisciplinary research that is most relevant to them in the field of disaster.
Reactions on social media are changing.
This will help in speedy management of the agency and ease of connecting the citizens with the authorities.
In the aftermath of the disaster, disaster affected people use social media to help each other.
The schedule will be prepared and implemented locally.
For example, if the local fire service officers had visited a school once every week, they could have made thousands of students aware within a year.
And in the end, we have to bring more unity in international response to disasters.
In the wake of disasters, we have to respond to disasters across the world.
Our efforts are to build disaster resilient structures and stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region.
Regional and international cooperation has a key role to play in taking our efforts forward.
India hosted the South Asian Annual Disaster Management Programme for the first time in November last year.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch a South Asia Satellite.

India is also the worlds largest producer of milk.
Through spices, we are all familiar with our trade relations with Europe and Southeast Asia.
Food processing is a lifestyle in India.
India is making rapid strides in Global Innovation Index, Global Logistics Index and Global Competitiveness Index.
It is easier to start a new business in India than before.

Today, we have representatives from some African countries.
This is an injustice to our long experience and many design talent.
The hairdresser decorates the hair of his customers.
