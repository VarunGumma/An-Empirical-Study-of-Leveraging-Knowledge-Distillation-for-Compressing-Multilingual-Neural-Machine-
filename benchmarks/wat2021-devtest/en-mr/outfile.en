It was very sad to see the movement of people affected by the earthquake.
Yet, the courage, extraordinary attitude and determination shown by these people to come out of the disaster inspired me.
I felt that the more we relied on the leadership of the people, the better the results were.
We must support such initiatives and leadership through policies and practices.
After the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the worst affected countries brought in new laws on disaster risk management.
In a few days, we will observe the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
Similar reforms have been undertaken with a view to get immediate warning of cyclone conditions.
If we compare the effects of cyclones between 1999 and 2013, we will be able to understand the progress we have made in this direction.
Now this programme is being counted among the best in the world.
There will be more challenges in the future.
If we have not been able to control this process through both planning and implementation, then the economic and loss of life due to disasters will be unprecedented.
In this context, I propose to you a 10-point manifesto aimed at improving our efforts towards disaster risk reduction.
First of all, all the sectors which are in the process of development should follow all the rules related to disaster risk management.
In the next two decades, most of the world's infrastructure will be built in our region.
While building these facilities, we must take care to build them on the basis of global standards to protect them from disasters.
India will work with our partner countries and other stakeholders to establish a Centre or a Alliance to encourage creation of such infrastructure that will survive disasters in these regions.
At present, insurance cover in most countries in the region is limited to middle and upper middle income groups only.
Due to Jan Dhan Yojana, lakhs of people have been included in the banking system.
The security insurance scheme has provided this protection to millions of people in need of insurance protection.
They have unique talent and vision.
Fourth, investment to review global risks.
We have adopted widely recognized standards and standards to review the risks associated with disasters, such as earthquakes.
As part of this network, various universities will be able to lay special emphasis on multisectoral research on the issues of disasters most related to them.
Reactions have been aplenty on social media.
These broadcasts have been helpful in quick preparedness of disaster management agencies and in providing immediate and easy citizen contact to the concerned authorities.
Social media is being used to help each other by people affected by disasters.
Specific types of management have to be designed and implemented locally.
For example, if a local fire service visits a school in the area every week, thousands of children will be able to create awareness in a year.
And finally, to mobilize a strong international response to disasters.
After the disaster, there is a wave of disaster relief from all over the world.
In our efforts to build the capacity to deal with disasters, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region.
Regional and international cooperation plays an important role in strengthening our efforts.
In November last year, India organized its first annual disaster management exercise in South Asia.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asian Satellite.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, let us welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.
