First of all, all the sectors in the development process should follow all the rules related to disaster risk management.
In the next two decades, most of the world's infrastructure will be built in our region.

Social media is being used by people who have been affected by disasters.
Specific types of management have to be structured and implemented locally.
For example, if a local fire service visits a school in the area every week, thousands of children can become aware in a year.
And, in the end, to mobilize a strong international response to disasters.
When disaster strikes, the world begins to flow through its turmoil and disaster relief efforts.
We will stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region in our efforts to build disaster resilience.
Regional and international cooperation has an important role to play in further strengthening our efforts.
