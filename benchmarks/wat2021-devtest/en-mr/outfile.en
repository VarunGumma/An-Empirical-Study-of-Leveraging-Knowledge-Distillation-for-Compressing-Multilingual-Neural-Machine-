It was very sad to see the plight of the people affected by this earthquake.
However, the courage, indomitable spirit and determination shown by these people to come out of the disaster inspired me.

We must support such initiatives and leadership through policies and practices.
After the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the most vulnerable countries brought in a new law to deal with disaster risk management.

Fourth, is to invest in reviewing the global risks.

The response has been widely shared on social media.
These broadcasters are helping the disaster response agencies to remain on standby and also to make people contact with the concerned authorities at the earliest.
Social media is being used to help people affected by disasters.
Specific types of management have to be designed and implemented at the local level.
For example, if a local fire service visits a school in that area every week, thousands of children will be able to create awareness in a year.
And finally, the integration of the international response to disasters.
In the aftermath of the disaster, there is a wave of relief from all corners of the world.
We will stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region in our efforts to build capacities to withstand disasters.
Regional and international cooperation plays an important role in strengthening our efforts.
