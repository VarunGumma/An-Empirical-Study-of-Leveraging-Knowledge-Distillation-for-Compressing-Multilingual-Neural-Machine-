In terms of natural disasters, seven of the top ten countries in the world are in the Asia-Pacific region.
The impact of the disaster is extremely painful to see the pain of the people.

We need to promote such initiatives and leadership through policies and practices.
In 2004, five countries which were severely affected by the Tsunami in the Indian Ocean brought in new laws to maintain their presence.

If we look at India, the impact of the cyclone in 1999 and 2013 will mean how much progress we have made.

There are many challenges ahead.
If we are not able to manage this growth on the planning and implementation stage properly, the loss of life and economic loss during disaster is at an unprecedented risk.

We have to invest globally in risk mapping.
The mapping of disasters like earthquakes has the standards and parameters approved globally.
As a part of this, universities should do research on a wide range of subjects that are suitable for their area in disaster management issues.
Social media needs to be transformed into a disaster response platform.
Social media will help the subsidiaries to respond quickly and connect citizens with the authorities easily.
Social media helps victims to help each other in times of disaster and disaster.
Special programmes should be planned and implemented locally.
For example, if a local firefighters go to a school in their area every week, thousands of children are made aware in a year.
Finally, it takes international response to disasters to one place.
After the disaster, disaster teams from all over the world will be deployed immediately.
Asia-Pacific countries must walk shoulder to shoulder to demonstrate their more efficient disaster management skills.
Regional and international cooperation plays an important role in taking our efforts forward at a faster pace.
In November last year, India conducted its first South Asian disaster management exercise.
India is soon going to launch the South Asian Satellite as part of a regional cooperative spirit.
As the Sendai Framework is being implemented, we invite new opportunities and regional international cooperation.
