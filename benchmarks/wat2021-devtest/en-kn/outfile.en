In the last twenty years, more than 850,000 people have died from disasters in the Asia Pacific.

I am saddened to see the suffering of the people.

There are challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this progress through planning and implementation, we are likely to increase the damage to economic and manpower even in the past.

First, all development sectors must adopt disaster risk management policies.
Most of the new infrastructure in the world will rise in our region in the next few decades.
We have to build them at the best available quality of disaster security.
India along with other partner countries and stakeholders will promote disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.

Fourth, investment in global risk assessment.
We have a wide range of accepted criteria for risk measurements such as earthquakes.

Social media can transform the response to disasters.
This will help the response agencies to prepare themselves at the earliest and help citizens connect more easily with the authority.
People affected by disasters are using social media to help each other.
Therefore, specific steps need to be taken locally.
For example, if a fire service team visits a school in their area every week, it can make thousands of students responsive within a year.
Finally, greater solidarity with the international response to disasters.
People of disasters, disaster responders, come from all over the world.
In our efforts to deal with the crisis, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region.
Regional and international cooperation has also played an important role in accelerating our efforts.
