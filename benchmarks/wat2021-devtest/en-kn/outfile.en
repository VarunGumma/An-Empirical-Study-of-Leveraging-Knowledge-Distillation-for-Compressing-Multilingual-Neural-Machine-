In the last twenty years, more than eight hundred and fifty thousand people have died in the disaster in the Asia Pacific.
Seven of the worlds ten most affected countries are in the Asia Pacific.
I am sad to see the suffering of the people affected.
But I am also inspired by their courage and the struggle to recover from the calamity.
In my experience, if we depend more on the peoples own leadership, the results will be better.
We have to bring such initiatives and leadership through policies and practices.

Social media sites transform disaster response.
This will help the Respondents to prepare themselves immediately and help the citizens to connect more easily with the Authority.
People affected by disasters are using social places to help each other.
Hence, certain measures need to be taken.
For example, if a fire service team visits a school in their area every week, it can make thousands of students responsive over a year.
Finally, greater integration into international response to disasters.
People from all over the world come, from all over the world.
In our effort to have a responsive system, we have stood shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region.
Regional and international cooperation has also played an important role in accelerating our efforts.
In November last year, India conducted the first South Asia Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of local cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
