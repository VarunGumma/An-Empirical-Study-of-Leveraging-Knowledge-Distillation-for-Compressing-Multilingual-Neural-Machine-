After the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, five of the five severely hit countries have brought in a new law for risk management.

If we do not manage this progress through planning and implementation, then the economic and human power losses are likely to rise.
In this context, I would like to highlight the ten point programme to update our efforts on disaster risk reduction:
First, all development sectors have to adopt disaster risk management policies.

At present, in most of the region, the insurance cover is limited to the middle and upper middle income group.

Fourth, investment in the global risk scale.

Social media transforms disaster response.
This will help the response agencies to prepare themselves immediately and will help citizens to interact more easily with the authority.
People affected by disasters are using social spaces to help one another.
Therefore, it has to be done locally.
For example, if a fire service team visits a school in their area every week, it can make thousands of students responsive over a period of one year.
Finally, there is greater integration of disasters with the international response.
Public, disaster victims and people from all over the world.
We stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region in our endeavour to deal with the crisis.
Regional and international cooperation has also played an important role in expediting our efforts.
