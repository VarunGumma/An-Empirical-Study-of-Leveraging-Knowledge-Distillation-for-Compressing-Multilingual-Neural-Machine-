In the last twenty years, more than eight hundred and fifty thousand people have died in the disaster in the Asia Pacific.
Seven of the worlds first ten countries to die from disasters are in the Pacific.
I am saddened to see the plight of the affected people.
But I am also inspired by their courage and struggle to recover from adversity.
In my experience, if we rely more on peoples own leadership, the results will be better.
We have to bring such initiatives and leadership through policies and practices.
After the 2004 Tsunami in the Indian Ocean, five severely affected countries have brought in a new law for risk management.
In a few days, we will be celebrating the first International Tsunami Day.
This will also apply to pre-emptive improvements in cyclone forecasting.

There are challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this progress through planning and implementation, the loss of economic and human power is likely to increase as never before.
In this context, I would like to emphasise the ten point agenda to renew our efforts towards disaster risk reduction:
First, all development sectors must adopt disaster risk management policies.
Most of the new infrastructure in the world will grow in our region in the next few decades.
We have to build them at the best available quality of disaster security.
India will encourage co-ordination of disaster resilient infrastructure in the region with other partner countries and stakeholders.
Currently, in most countries in the sector, insurance is limited to middle and middle class income groups only.
The Jan Dhan Yojana has brought millions of people under the banking system.
The Security Insurance Scheme has provided possible risk insurance cover to lakhs of people who are in need.
They have unique energy and insight.
Fourth, investment in risk measurement globally.
We have widely accepted standards in measuring risks such as earthquakes.
As part of this network, various universities gain expertise in multi-disciplinary research on the subject of distraction that they feel is more appropriate.
Social media transforms disaster response.
This will help the response agencies to mobilize themselves immediately and help the citizens to connect more easily with the authority.
People affected by disasters are using social media to help each other.
Therefore, specific steps need to be taken locally.
For example, if a fire service team visits a school in their area every week, it can make thousands of students responsive within a year.
Finally, greater solidarity in international response to disasters.
Disaster public, disaster responders come from all over the world.
We stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region in our efforts to overcome the crisis.
Regional and international cooperation has also played an important role in accelerating our efforts.
In November last year, India conducted the first South Asia Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of local cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
After we implement the Sendai Framework, we welcome new opportunities for local and international cooperation.
