It seems like a question of life and death.
The exams that you are going to give are the exams that you have studied in a year.
This is not the test of your life.
So I would like to be aware of your views on this present direction of education and its future.
Is there any synergy between your mission and your acceptance, the sense of mission that you have received?
And that is why the burden of this number also sometimes prevents us from going in the right direction.
But if there are questions outside what you have put your hand on, if there are questions outside what you have asked, then you will soon come down.
If you keep knowledge at the centre, you try to cover a lot of things in yourself.

In the last 20 years, 8.5 lakh people have been killed in disasters in countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
Seven of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of the highest number of deaths due to natural disasters belong to the Asia-Pacific region.
It was very painful to see the pain of the victims.
But I was also encouraged by their courage, proficiency and determination to come out of the disaster.
According to my experience, the better results we are relying on our leadership.
We need to support such initiatives and leadership through policies and practices.
In 2004, five countries, severely affected by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean, had enacted laws to deal with disaster risks.
In a few days, we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
Similarly, the first warning of cyclones has also been revised.
In India, if we compare the impact of cyclones in 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress we have made in this regard.
It is now recognized as one of the best practices at the international level.
There are still big challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this development, that is, planning and implementation of those schemes properly, then the loss of revenue and life during disasters will be more than ever before.
In this context, I would like to share the framework of the 10-point agenda to renew our efforts to reduce disasters:
First, all areas of development must look at the principles of disaster risk.
In the next two decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be in our region.
We need to ensure that we build the best available standards of safety during disaster.
India will work with other partner countries and stakeholders to form an alliance or centre to promote disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
At present, insurance facilities in most countries in the region are limited to middle class and upper middle class income groups.
Jan Dhan Yojana has brought crores of people under the banking system.
The Insurance Scheme provides risk insurance to crores of people who need it the most.
They have unique strengths and weaknesses.
Fourth, invest in identifying threats internationally.
In terms of designing threats, as we have widely recognized standards and parameters for earthquakes.
As part of this network, various universities can specialize in multi-disciplinary research on destructive and appropriate issues.
Social media is changing the response to disasters.
It is helping the relief agencies to be immediately integrated, connect the citizens more easily with the authorities.
Victims are using social media to help each other during the riots.
They have to be implemented by preparing special works at the local level.
For example, if local fire services go to a school in their area every week, they will be able to make thousands of children aware in a year.
And finally, international response in case of disasters should be brought in more.
In the post-disaster period, people from all over the world come to help immediately in times of disaster.
In our efforts to withstand the onslaught of disasters, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region.
Regional and international cooperation plays an important role in our efforts.
In November last year, India conducted the first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.

The thinking of the government will be discussed and I think a very good debate will also take place during the session.
All parties will make a very good contribution.
I am very happy to be a part of this huge gathering of world leaders and decision makers in the food processing industry.
India is also the worlds largest producer of milk.
We are all aware of the trade relations that have been established through our spice with Europe and Southeast Asia.
Food processing is a way of life in India.
India is making rapid progress in the Global Innovation Index, Global Logistics Index and Global Competitiveness Index.
Starting a new business in India has now become easier than before.
The system of obtaining clearance from various agencies has been simplified.
Now I come especially towards food processing.

Through these food parks, we want to connect agro processing clusters with major production centres.
We are improving management with the help of digital technology to improve the last phase of delivery of goods.

At present, we are the sixth largest producer and exporter of honey in the world.

Now about 3000 small and medium businesses have this benefit through the new authorised sector.
Skill India aims to ensure that new entrants to the working sector have the necessary skills to contribute to the 21st century economy.
The Ratan and Jewellery sector has provided employment to 4.6 million people.
Of these, only one million are in the diamond industry alone.
Therefore, the Ratan and Jewellery sector is an important example of the potential of Make in India and Skill India.
Today, ministers from many African countries are with us.
This is not justice to our rich experience and design genius.
Even hair drivers are changing the style of their customers.
We are living in an era where diamonds are used in glasses, watches and pens.
There was a time when many products of India became popular in the world.
I hope that is why the industry will remain in regular touch with them.
What goals will the Ratan and Jewellery industry set for themselves for that date?
If they are in the interest of the country, we must think about them.
