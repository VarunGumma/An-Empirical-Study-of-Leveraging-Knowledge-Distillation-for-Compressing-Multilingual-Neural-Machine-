The exams that you are going to give are the exams that you have studied throughout the year.
This is not the test of your life.
So I want to be aware of your views on this present direction of education and its future.
Is there any synergy between your mission and Ambition that you have got a sense of mission and which is your sense of purpose?

If you keep knowledge at the centre, you try to cover a lot of things in yourself.

In the last 20 years, eight and a half lakh people have been killed in disasters in Asia-Pacific countries.
Seven of the worlds top 10 countries in terms of the highest number of deaths due to natural disasters belong to the Asia-Pacific region.
It was very difficult to see the pain of the victims.
But I was also encouraged by their courage, professionalism and determination to come out of the disaster.
According to my experience, the better results we depend on our leadership.
We need to support such initiatives and leadership through policies and practices.
In 2004, five countries, severely affected by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean, enacted laws to deal with disasters.
In a few days, we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
Similarly, early warning of cyclones has also been revised.
In India, if we compare the impact of cyclones in 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress we have made in this regard.
It is now recognized as one of the best practices at the international level.
There are still big challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this development, that is, planning and implementation of those schemes properly, then the loss of revenue and life during disasters will be much higher than before.
In this context, I would like to share a 10-point agenda framework to renew our efforts to mitigate the threat in times of disasters:
First, all development sectors must look at the principles of disaster risk.
In the next two decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be in our region.
We need to ensure that we build the best available available standards of safety during disasters.
India will work with other partner countries and stakeholders to form an alliance or centre to promote disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
At present, insurance facilities in most countries in the region are limited to middle class and upper middle class income groups.
Jan Dhan Yojana has brought crores of people under the banking system.
The Suraksha Bima Yojana provides risk insurance to crores of people who need it the most.
They have unique strengths and weaknesses.
Fourth, investment in identification of threats internationally.
In terms of designing threats, as we have widely recognized standards and standards for earthquakes.
As part of this network, various universities can specialize in multi-disciplinary research on destructive and appropriate issues.
Social media is changing the response at the time of disaster.
It is helping the relief agencies to be immediately integrated, connect the citizens more easily with the authorities.
Victims are using social media to help each other during the riots.
Special local level works will have to be prepared and implemented.
For example, if local fire services go to a school in their area every week, they will be able to make thousands of children aware in a year.
And finally, international response in case of disasters should be brought in more.
In the post-disaster period, people from all over the world come to help immediately in times of disaster.
In our efforts to withstand the devastation, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region.
Regional and international cooperation plays an important role in our efforts.
In November last year, India conducted the first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we will welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.

All parties will make a very good contribution.

The Ratan and Jewellery sector has provided employment to 4.6 million people.
Out of this, only one million are in the diamond industry alone.
Therefore, the Ratan and Jewellery sector is an important example of the potential of Make in India and Skill India.
Today, ministers from many African countries are with us.
This is not justice with our rich experience and design talent.
Even hairdressers are changing the hair style of their customers.
We live in an era where diamonds are used in glasses, watches and pens.
There was a time when many Indian products became popular in the world.
I hope that the industry will remain in regular touch with them.
