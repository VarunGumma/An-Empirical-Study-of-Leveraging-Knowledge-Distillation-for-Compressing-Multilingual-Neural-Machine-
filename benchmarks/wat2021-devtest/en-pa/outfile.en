My young friends, you are well aware that I keep talking about Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April - All these months are the test months in every family.

The change will come as soon as you see it.
In fact, from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these examinations are conducted for 3-4 months.
And that is why the biggest thing to recall memory is that if there is a cure, it is relaxation.
Sometimes it also seems that we are not able to see the exam in the proper perspective.
It seems like a question of life and death.
The examination that you are going to give is an exam of what you have studied throughout the year.
This is not the test of your life.
So, I want to be aware of your views on this present direction of education and its future.
Life is going on in such a way that the sense of mission that you have got and the sense of ambetion that you have got, is there any coordination between your mission and Ambition?
And that is why the burden of this number also sometimes prevents us from going in the right direction.
But if there is any question that comes out of the things that you have touched, if there are questions from outside that question that you have prepared, then you will come down immediately.
If you keep knowledge at the centre, you try to assimilate a lot of things into yourself.
This is a very big psychological battle.
He said that the role of parents in examinations is very important.
Youre right
These short-cut routes lead to copying.
Well, young friends, you are preparing for the exam and I am stuck to your thoughts.

Go ahead with this mantra.

In the last twenty years, 8.5 million people have been killed in disasters in Asia-Pacific countries.
Seven out of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of the highest number of deaths due to natural disasters belong to the Asia-Pacific region.
It was very painful to see the pain of the victims.
But I was also encouraged by their courage, ingenuity and determination to come out of the disaster.
As per my experience, the more people we depend on our leadership, the better the results were.
We need to support such initiatives and leadership through policies and practices.
Five countries, which were badly affected by the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, had enacted laws to deal with disasters.
In a few days, we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
Similarly, early warning of cyclones has also been improved.
In India, if we compare the impact of cyclones in 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress made by us in this regard.
It is now recognized as the best international practice.
There are still big challenges.
If we do not manage this development, that is, plan and implement those schemes properly, then the fiscal and loss of life during disasters will be much higher than ever before.
In this context, I would like to share the framework of the 10-point agenda to renew our efforts to reduce the risk in times of disasters:
First, all areas of development must take note of the principles of disaster risk management.
In the next two decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be in our region.
We need to ensure that we build the best available standards of safety during disasters.
India will work with other partner countries and stakeholders to form an alliance or Centre to promote disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
At present, insurance facilities in most countries in the region are limited to people with middle class and upper middle class income groups.
Jan Dhan Yojana has brought crores of people under the banking system.
The Suraksha Bima Yojana provides risk insurance to crores of people who need it the most.
They have unique strengths and weaknesses.
Fourth, investing in identifying threats internationally.
In cases of risk formulation, as we have large scale recognized standards and parameters for earthquakes.
As part of this network, various universities can specialize in multi-disciplinary research on issues capable of destruction and reasonable.
Social media is changing the response to disasters.
It is helping the response agencies to be immediately integrated and citizens to connect with the authorities more easily.
During the floods, victims are using social media to help each other.
They have to be implemented by preparing and implementing special works at the local level.
For example, if local fire services go to a school in their area every week, it will be able to make thousands of children aware in a year.
And finally, international response in case of disasters should be brought in more.
In the post-disaster times, people from all over the world come to help immediately in times of disaster.
In our effort to withstand the shocks of destruction, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region.
Regional and international cooperation plays an important role in our efforts.
In November last year, India conducted its first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we will welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.

All parties will make a very good contribution.

To improve the last phase of delivery of goods, we are improving management with the help of digital technology.

Skill India aims to ensure that new persons going to work areas have the necessary skills to contribute to the 21st century economy.
