Over the last twenty years, eight and a half million people have been killed in disasters in the Asia-Pacific countries.
Seven of the top 10 countries in the world are in the Asia-Pacific region.
It was very painful to see the sufferings of the victims.
But I was also encouraged by their courage, professionalism and determination to come out of the disaster.
As per my experience, the more people we depend on our leadership, the better results came.
We need to support such initiatives and leadership through policies and practices.
Five countries, severely affected by the Indian Ocean Tsunami during 2004, had enacted laws to deal with disasters.
In a few days, we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
Similarly, there have also been an improvement in the early warning of cyclonic storm.
In India, if we compare the impact of the cyclones of 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress made in this regard.
It is now recognized as one of the best practices at the international level.
There are big challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this development, that is, plan and implement those schemes properly, then the financial and financial losses during disasters will be much higher than before.
In this context, I would like to share the framework of the 10-point agenda to renew our efforts to reduce the disaster risk:
First, all areas of development must consider the principles of disaster risk management.
In the next two decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be in our region.
We need to ensure that we build the best available standards of safety and security during disasters.
India will work with other partner countries and stakeholders to establish an alliance or a hub to promote disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
At present, in most of the countries of the region, insurance facilities are limited to the middle class and upper middle class income groups.
Jan Dhan Yojana has brought crores of people under the banking system.
The Suraksha Bima Yojana provides risk insurance to crores of people who need it the most.
They have unique strengths and weaknesses.
Fourth, invest in identifying risks at the international level.
In terms of shaping risks, such as we have a large number of recognized standards and parameters for landslides.
As part of this network, various universities can specialize in multi-disciplinary research on possible and relevant issues of destruction.
Social media is changing the response to disasters.
It is helping the rescue agencies to get in touch with the authorities more easily.
Victims are using social media to help each other during the riots.
They will have to prepare and implement special tasks at the local level.
For example, if local fire services reach a school in their area every week, it will make thousands of children aware in a year.
And, in the end, there should be more international response in the case of migration.
In the aftermath of the disaster, people from all over the world come forward to help in times of disaster.
We stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries of the region in our efforts to respond to the devastation.
Regional and international cooperation plays an important role in our efforts.
In November last year, India had conducted its first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch a South Asia Satellite.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we will welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.
