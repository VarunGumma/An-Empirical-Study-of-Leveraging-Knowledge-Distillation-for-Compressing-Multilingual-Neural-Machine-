In the last two decades, eight lakh fifty thousand people have lost their lives due to disasters
Seven of the worlds ten most deaths are in the Asia Pacific region.
It was sad to see the sufferings of the affected people.

First, disaster management precautions must be followed in all the developed areas.

A specific action plan should be prepared.
If the local fire service goes to a school every week, thousands of students will be able to teach fire operations.
Finally, there is a need to increase international response in times of disasters.
Disaster reactors from many countries are gathered at the site after the disaster.
We have to stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries in disaster relief operations.
