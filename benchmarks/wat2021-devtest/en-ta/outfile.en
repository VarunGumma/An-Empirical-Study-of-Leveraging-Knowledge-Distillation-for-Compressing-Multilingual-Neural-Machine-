In the last two decades, eight lakh fifty thousand people have lost their lives due to disasters
Seven of the world's top ten deaths are in the Asia Pacific region.
It was sad to see the sufferings of the affected people.
At the same time, I was surprised by their courage and determination to recover from the disaster.
In my experience, the more we believe in the leadership of the people, the better the results will be.
We must support such voluntary acts and leadership through right policies and practices.
After the 2004 Tsunami in the Indian Ocean, all the five affected countries brought in new disaster management laws.
In a few days from now, we are going to celebrate the first International Tsunami Memorial.
Similar improvements have been made in cyclone warning.
Compared to the cyclones from 1999 to 2013, we know how much we have improved now.
This practice has now been adopted internationally.
There are big challenges still.
If we do not control this growth through planning and implementation, the high mortality rate cannot be prevented.
Keeping this in mind, I would like to mention a ten-point policy to improve our disaster management:
First, disaster management precautions must be followed in all advanced areas.
In a few decades from now, all new infrastructure will be brought to our region
We have to ensure that these are built according to disaster security.
India will work with international organizations and countries to build disaster resilient infrastructure in these areas.
In many countries of this region, insurance is available only from the middle class to the middle class.
Jan Dhan Yojana has brought lakhs of people to the banks
The Suraksha Bima Yojana provides risk insurance.
We have to train a large number of women volunteers.
Fourth, invest in identifying risks.
We have widely adopted a number of practices and policies to map earthquakes.
Research on disaster management should be carried out through this network.
Social media has increased information exchange in times of disasters.
These help the organizations to regulate themselves and help them quickly.
In every disaster, there has been an increase in the number of people helping each other through social media.
There should be specific action plans.
If the local fire service goes to a school every week, thousands of students can be taught fire fighting operations.
Finally, international response in times of disasters needs to be enhanced.
Disaster response personnel from several countries have gathered at the site after the disaster.
We have to stand shoulder to shoulder with all the countries in the rescue operations.
Regional and international cooperation plays a major role in this regard.
India conducted its first South Asia Annual Disaster Management Exercise in November last year.
With regional cooperation in mind, India will launch a South Asia Satellite.
We welcome regional and international cooperation during the implementation of the Sendai Framework Act.
