Over the last twenty years, more than 650,000 people have died in disasters in Asia and the Pacific.
Asia-Pacific countries are the seventh worst-hit country in the world.
It was sad to see the victims.
But their own integrity and determination to overcome the disaster inspired me.
In my experience, if we trust the leadership of the people more, we will get good results.
We need to support such excellence and initiatives through policies and actions.
After the 2004 Tsunami in the Indian Ocean, five affected countries enacted new Disaster Risk Protection Laws.
The first International Tsunami Awareness Day is coming soon.
A similar system is also in place to develop a cyclone warning system.
In India, compared to the impact of cyclones in 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress we have made.
It has now been recognized as one of the best in the world.
There are daunting challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this growth in planning and management, the human loss and economic disruption caused by disasters will be much higher than ever before.
In this context, I propose a ten point agenda to renew our efforts for disaster risk reduction:
First of all, all development sectors must adopt principles of disaster risk management.
In the next few decades, most of the world's advanced infrastructure will emerge in our region.
We have to ensure that they are built at the best possible quality to ensure safety from disasters.
India will work with its allies and other stakeholders to build a disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
At present, insurance is limited to the middle class and upper middle class in the mixed countries of the region.
Jan Dhan Yojana has brought millions of people into the banking system.
Insurance cover has been made available to the most needy through the insurance scheme.
They have special strength and vision.
Fourth, efforts should be made to identify vulnerable areas globally.
We have generally accepted standards and standards for calculating accidents related to disasters such as earthquakes.
As part of this, different universities can do research alone or collectively on disaster issues that we feel are most relevant to.
The social media has brought about a massive change in its response to disasters.
This medium will help in speedy preparedness of disaster management agencies and easy contact with people and authorities.
In every disaster, the victims use social media to help each other.
Special programmes should be organised at the local level.
For example, if the local unit of the fire brigade visits every school every week, thousands of people can be informed about it in a year.
Finally, there should be increased international consensus in response to disasters.
When disasters strike, they will receive help from all over the world.
Countries in the region must stand shoulder to shoulder to create disaster response.
Regional international cooperation can be more supportive of our efforts.
India had organized the first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise in November last year.
India is soon going to launch the South Asian Satellite.
As we implement the Sedai Framework, we welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.
The Government is constantly working to create a conducive business environment in the country.

I look forward to a good and healthy debate with good contributions from all political parties.
I am happy to be a part of this great partnership of global leaders and decision makers in the field of food processing.

It is easier today to start a business in India than ever before.

Honey is natures gift to mankind.
Now we are the sixth largest producer and exporter of honey.

With the launch of this special notified area today, more than 3000 small and medium traders are availing this facility.
The aim of Skill India is to ensure that the new entrants to the working society have the skill to contribute to the 21st century economy.

Of these, one million workers are in the diamond industry for livelihood.
Then the Gems and Jewellery sector itself is an example of great potential for Make in India and Skill India.
Ministers from many African countries are with us today.
This attitude never brings justice to our rich experience and design tradition.
The haircut determines the style of the head of his customer.
We live in an era of diamonds falling even in glasses and watches.
We have a past when some of Indias products have gained global popularity.
I think the industrialists working in this sector are in touch with them.

If they are in the interest of our country, then they will definitely be considered.
