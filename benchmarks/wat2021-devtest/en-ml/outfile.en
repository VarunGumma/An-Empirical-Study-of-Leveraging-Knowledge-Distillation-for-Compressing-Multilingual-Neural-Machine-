Over the last twenty years, more than 650,000 people have died in Asia-Pacific disasters.
Asia-Pacific countries are the seventh worst affected country in the world.
It was sad to see the victims.
But their own integrity and determination to overcome the disaster inspired me.
In my experience, if we trust the leadership of the people more, we will get good results.
We need to support such excellence and initiatives through policies and actions.
After the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, five affected countries enacted new Disaster Risk Prevention Acts.
The first International Tsunami Awareness Day is coming up soon.
Similar is the case with the development of cyclone warning system.
In India, compared to the impact of the cyclone in 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress we have made.
It has now been recognized as one of the best in the world.
There are daunting challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this growth in planning and management, the human loss and economic disruption from disasters will be much higher than before.
In this context, I propose a ten - point agenda to renew our efforts for disaster risk reduction:
First of all, all development sectors should have the principles of disaster risk management.
In the next few decades, most of the world's innovative infrastructure will emerge in our region.
We have to ensure that they are built at the best possible quality to ensure safety from disasters.
India will work with its allies and other stakeholders to build a disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
At present, the insurance cover is limited to the middle class and upper middle class in the mixed states of the region.
Jan Dhan Yojana has brought millions of people into the banking system.
Insurance cover has been made available to the most needy through the insurance scheme.
They have special strength and insight.
Fourth, efforts should be made to identify vulnerable areas globally.
We have generally agreed standards and standards to assess accidents related to disasters such as earthquakes.
As part of this, different universities can do research alone or jointly on disaster issues that we feel are most relevant to.
The social media has brought about a paradigm shift in the response to disasters.
This medium will help in speedy preparedness of disaster management agencies and easy contact with people and authorities.
In every disaster, the victims use social media to help each other.
Special programmes should be organised at the local level.
For example, if the local unit of the fire brigade visits every school every week, thousands of people can get to know about it in a year.
Finally, there should be increased international solidarity in response to disasters.
When disasters strike, we will get help from all over the world.
Countries in the region must stand shoulder to shoulder to create disaster resilient.
Regional international cooperation can be more supportive of our efforts.
India had organized the first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise in November last year.
India is soon going to launch the South Asian Satellite.
As we implement the Sedai Framework, we welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.
