Over the last twenty years, more than eight hundred and fifty thousand people have died due to disasters in Asia and the Pacific.
Asia and the Pacific are the seventh worst affected countries in the world.
It was sad to see the victims.
But their integrity and determination to overcome the disaster inspired me.
In my experience, if we trust the leadership of the people more, it will have good results.
We need to support such skills and initiatives through policies and actions.
After the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, five affected countries enacted new Disaster Risk Protection Laws.
The first International Tsunami Awareness Day is coming soon.
There is also a similar system for developing cyclone warning system.
In India, we can see the progress made by us when we compare the impact of cyclones in 1999 and 2013.
It is now recognized as one of the best in the world.
There are daunting challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this growth in planning and management, the human loss and economic disruption caused by disasters will be much higher than before.
In this context, I propose a ten agenda to revise our efforts for disaster risk mitigation:
First of all, all development sectors must have principles to deal with disaster risk.
In the next few decades, most of the world's innovative infrastructure will emerge in our region.
We have to ensure that they are built in the best possible quality to ensure safety from disasters.
India will work with its allies and other stakeholders to build a Centre for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure in the region.
At present, the insurance cover in the rest of the region is limited to the middle class and upper class.
Jan Dhan Yojana has brought millions of people into the banking system.
Through the Security Insurance Scheme, insurance cover has been made available to the most needy.
They have special power and insight.
Fourth, globally, efforts should be made to identify vulnerable areas.
We have generally accepted standards and standards for calculating disasters such as earthquakes.
As a part of this, different universities can do research alone or jointly on disaster issues that we find most relevant to.
Social media has brought about a massive change in the response to disasters.
This media will help in quick preparedness of disaster management agencies and easy contact with people and authorities.
In every tragedy, the victims use social media to help each other.
Special programmes should be organised at the local level.
For example, if the local unit of the fire brigade visits each school every week, thousands of friends will be able to know about it in a year.
Finally, there should be increased international consensus in response to disasters.
When there is a disaster, help will come from all over the world.
Countries in the region must work shoulder to shoulder to create disaster response.
Regional and international cooperation can further support our efforts.
India had organised its first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise in November last year.
India is soon going to launch a South Asian satellite.
As we implement the Sedai Framework, we welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.
