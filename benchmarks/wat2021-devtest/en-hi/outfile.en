Life goes on to say that the sense of mission that you have got and the sense of ambetion that you have got, is there any coordination between your mission and your mission?
And that is why the burden of this number sometimes prevents us from going in the right direction.

In the last 20 years, 580,000 people have lost their lives due to disasters in the Asia Pacific region.
Seven countries in the Asia Pacific region are among the top 10 countries with the highest number of deaths due to the disaster.
It is painful to see people suffering from disasters.
But I was inspired by the courage, simplicity and determination of the people to overcome the disaster.
From my experience, we have to rely on peoples leadership to achieve better results.
We need to support such initiatives through policies and actions.
After the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, five of the most affected countries enacted new laws on disaster risk mitigation management.
In a few days, we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
Similarly, advance information about the cyclone has been issued.
In India, if we compare the effects of the cyclone in 1999 and 2013, the effects will be clearly visible.
It is considered to be the best global programme in the world.
There are more challenges ahead.
If we are not able to manage this progress in planning and its implementation, the human and economic damage caused by the disaster will be higher than before.
In this context, we have outlined a ten-point agenda for renewal of our efforts towards disaster risk reduction which is as follows:
First, in all areas of development, we have to imbibe the principles of disaster mitigation management.
The world's largest infrastructure to be built in the next two decades will be in our region.
We need to ensure that high standards of disaster safety are followed in their construction.
In this region, India, along with its other partner countries and stakeholders, will form an alliance or Centre to promote disaster resilient infrastructure.
Currently, in this sector, most countries have limited insurance arrangements only for the middle to upper middle class.
Jan Dhan Yojana has connected crores of people with the banking system.
The Security Insurance Scheme has provided risk insurance to crores of people who are in dire need of it.
They have unique powers and insights.
Fourth, globally there is a need to invest in risk mapping.
There is a need to prepare disaster mapping such as for earthquakes, we need to widely accept standards and norms.
In addition to this network, various universities will be able to carry out specialized research in both these areas on disaster issues, which will be more relevant.
Social media is changing the response to disasters.
It is helping the agencies at a rapid pace and this makes it easier for citizens to establish contact with the concerned authorities.
People affected by disasters and disasters are using social media to help each other.
A specific action plan is being prepared and implemented locally.
For example, if a fire extinguisher team visits a school in their area every week, it will make school children more sensitive to it throughout the year.
And finally, there has to be greater international coordination to deal with disasters.
After a disaster, the whole world will have to take responsibility for it.
We will work shoulder to shoulder with the countries of these regions to deal with disasters.
Regional and international cooperation will help in taking forward such activities.
In November last year, India organized the first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
Just as we have implemented the Sendai Framework, we will welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.
