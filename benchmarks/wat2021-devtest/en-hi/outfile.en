It is painful to see the victims.
But I was inspired by the courage, simplicity and determination of the people to recover from the disaster.
From my experience, to achieve better results, we have to rely on peoples leadership.
We need to support such initiatives through policies and actions.
After the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, five of the five most affected countries have enacted new laws for disaster risk reduction management.

If we are unable to manage this progress on planning and implementation, the humanitarian and economic impact of the disaster will be greater than before.
In this context, a 10-point agenda has been formulated to renew our efforts towards disaster risk reduction, which is as follows:
First, in all areas of development, we have to imbibe the principles of disaster mitigation management.
In the next two decades, the world's largest infrastructure will be in our region.
We need to ensure that high standards of disaster protection are followed in their construction.
In this sector, India along with its other partner countries and stakeholders will form an alliance or a hub for disaster resilient infrastructure.

They have unique powers and insights.
Fourth, there is a need to invest in risk mapping globally.

In addition to this network, various universities will be able to carry out expert research work on disaster issues in both these areas, which will be more relevant.
Social media is changing the disaster response.
It is assisting the agencies at a fast pace and this will facilitate citizens to approach the authorities concerned.
People affected by disasters and disasters are using social media to help one another.
A specific action plan is being prepared and implemented locally.
For example, if a fire extinguisher visits a school in his area every week, it will make the school children sensitive throughout the year.
And ultimately, there has to be more and more international coordination to deal with disasters.
After a disaster, the whole world will have to take responsibility.
We will work shoulder to shoulder with the countries of these regions to deal with disasters.
Regional and international cooperation will help in taking forward such activities.
In November last year, India had conducted its first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch a South Asia Satellite.
Just as we have implemented the Sendai Framework, we will welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.
