In the last 20 years, there have been 5.80 lakh deaths due to disasters in the Asia Pacific region.
Seven countries in the Asia Pacific region account for the highest number of deaths due to the disaster.
It is painful to see the victims of disaster.
But I was inspired by the courage, simplicity and resolve of the people to overcome the disaster.
From my experience, to achieve better results, we have to trust the leadership of the people.
We need to support such initiatives through policies and actions.
After the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the five most affected countries enacted new laws on disaster risk mitigation management.
In a few days, we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
Similarly, prior information about the cyclone has been issued.
In India, the impact will be evident if we compare the impact of the cyclone in 1999 and 2013.
It is considered to be the best global event in the world.
There are other challenges ahead.
If we are not able to manage this progress on planning and implementation, the human and economic damage caused by the disaster will be higher than before.
In this context, we have outlined a 10-point agenda for renewal of our efforts towards disaster risk reduction, which is as follows:
First, in all areas of development, we have to imbibe the principles of disaster mitigation management.
The world's largest infrastructure to be built in the next two decades will be in our region.
We need to ensure that high standards of disaster safety are followed in their construction.
In this area, India along with its other partner countries and stakeholders will build an alliance or centre to promote disaster response infrastructure.
At present, in this sector, most countries have made limited arrangements for insurance only for the middle to upper middle class.
Jan Dhan Yojana has connected crores of people with banking practices.
The Suraksha Bima Yojana has provided risk insurance to crores of people who desperately need it.
They have unique powers and insights.
Fourth, there is a need to invest in risk mapping globally.
There is a need to prepare mapping related to disasters such as earthquakes that we need to adopt standards and norms in a big way.
In addition to this network, various universities will be able to carry out specialized research in these two areas on disaster issues, which will be more relevant.
Social media is changing the disaster response.
It is helping the agencies at a rapid pace and easily connects with the civic authorities concerned.
People affected in disaster and after disaster are using social media to help each other.
A specific action plan is being prepared and implemented locally.
For example, if a fire fighting team visits a school in their area every week, it will make school children aware of it throughout the year.
And finally, more and more synergy has to be brought about internationally to deal with disasters.
After a disaster, the whole world will have to take responsibility for it.
We will work shoulder to shoulder with countries in this region to deal with disasters.
Regional and international cooperation will help in carrying forward such work.
In November last year, India organized the first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
With a spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
Just as we have implemented the Sendai Framework, we will welcome new opportunities for regional and international cooperation.

There are opportunities that are waiting to be used.
