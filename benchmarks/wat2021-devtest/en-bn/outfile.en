In the last 20 years, 8.50 lakh people have lost their lives due to disasters in the Asia-Pacific region.
Seven of the first hundred countries to die from disasters are in the Asia-Pacific region.
The plight of the victims was very painful.
But their courage, determination and thoughts inspired me to come out of the clutches of disaster.
The more we have reposed our faith in the leadership of the common man, the more we have benefited from my experience.
Such initiatives and leadership need to be supported through policy formulation and implementation.
After the 2014 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, five of the most vulnerable countries have developed new laws to deal with disasters.
In a few days, we are going to celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
This has also been made possible by early warning of cyclones.
If we compare the damage caused by the 1999 and 2013 cyclones in India, we will see our progress.
Therefore, such a system has now been recognized as the best in the world.
We have big challenges ahead.
Therefore, if we are not able to manage this progress properly through planning and implementation, the risk of economic loss and loss of life due to disasters is likely to increase much more than ever before.
In this context, I propose a ten-point programme to reorient our efforts to avoid the risk of disasters:
First, the policy of disaster risk management should be adopted in every field of development.
In just a few decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be built in our region.
To protect ourselves from disasters, we have to ensure that these infrastructure is built.
India will build an environment of cooperation with other partner countries and all stakeholders to build disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
Today, in most of the countries of the region, insurance is available only to the middle class and the upper middle class.
Jan Dhan Yojana has connected crores of people to the banking system.
More than one lakh people have been covered under the Suraksha Bima Yojana, who require this insurance the most in their lives.
But they have a lot of confidence and insight.
Fourth, investment is required in all countries of the world to assess the risk.
We have extensively applied specific standards and parameters to assess the risk of disasters like earthquakes and based on this, we have identified seismic zones and regions in India.
As part of this network, various universities will have the opportunity to undertake multi-pronged research and research on disaster related issues.
Social media has brought about a paradigm shift in dealing with disasters.
As a result, the agencies involved are able to communicate quickly with each other and the citizens are also getting the opportunity to interact with the authorities concerned with each other with the help of each other.
We must recognize the potential of social media.
However, the work needs to be started at the local level.
For example, if a fire brigade selects a school every week, thousands of children can gain knowledge about disaster management within a year.
And, in the end, we have to strengthen international cooperation in disaster management.
In the aftermath of a disaster, various countries have extended a helping hand to the world.
We are ready to work with all the countries of the region to combat the disaster.
Regional and international cooperation will encourage our efforts.
India hosted the first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Programme in November last year.
It is this strength of regional cooperation that is encouraging India to launch South Asian satellites very soon.
We welcome new areas of regional and international cooperation as well as implementation of the Cenditive Agenda.

I hope that with the good participation of all the political parties, a healthy and beautiful atmosphere of debate and discussion will be created.

Honey is a unique gift of nature to mankind.
We are currently ranked 6th in terms of production and export of honey.
India is now fully prepared for a sweet revolution.

Fish and fish farming techniques are exported to about 95 countries of the world.

They can also be produced in adverse agricultural climate conditions.
