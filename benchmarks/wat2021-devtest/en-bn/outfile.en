In the last 20 years, 8.50 lakh people have lost their lives due to disasters in the Asia-Pacific region.
Seven of the first countries to die from disasters are in the Asia-Pacific region.
The plight of the victims was very painful.
But their courage, determination and thoughts inspired me to come out of the clutches of disaster.
The more we have reposed faith in my experience under the leadership of the common man, the more we have benefited.
Such initiatives and leadership need to be supported through policy formulation and implementation.
After the 2014 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the five most vulnerable countries have developed new laws to deal with disasters.
In a few days, we are going to celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
This has also been done in the wake of early cyclone warning.
If we compare the damage caused by the 1999 and 2013 cyclones in India, we will realize our progress.
Therefore, such a system has now been recognized as the best in the world.
We have big challenges ahead.
Therefore, if we are not able to manage this progress properly through planning and implementation, the risk of economic loss and loss of life due to disasters is likely to increase even further.
In such a situation and in the context, I would like to present here a roadmap for a ten-point programme to reorient our efforts to avoid the risk of disasters:
First, the policy of disaster risk management should be adopted in every field of development.
In just a few decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be built in our region.
We have to ensure that these infrastructure is built in a specific way to protect us from disasters.
India will collaborate with other partners and stakeholders to build disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
Today, in most of the countries of the region, insurance is available only to the middle class and upper middle class people.
Jan Dhan Yojana has connected crores of people with the banking system.
More than one lakh people have been covered under the Suraksha Bima Yojana, which is the most important requirement in their lives.
But they have a lot of confidence.
Fourth, investment is needed in all countries of the world to assess the risk.
We have made extensive use of specific standards and measurements to assess the risk of earthquakes, and based on this, we in India have identified seismic prone areas.
As part of this network, universities will have the opportunity to undertake multi-pronged research and research on disaster related issues.
Social media has brought about a paradigm shift in dealing with disasters.
As a result, the agencies involved are able to communicate with each other at the earliest and the citizens are also easily able to communicate with the authorities concerned with each other.
We must recognize the potential of social media.
But the work has to start at the local level.
For example, if a fire brigade selects a school every week, thousands of children can gain knowledge about the details of disaster management within a year.
And, in the end, we have to strengthen international cooperation in disaster management.
Different countries extend a helping hand from different parts of the world after any disaster.
We are ready to work with all the countries of the region to prevent disasters.
Regional and international cooperation will encourage our efforts.
India hosted its first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Programme in November last year.
It is this strength of regional cooperation that is encouraging India to launch South Asian satellites soon.
We welcome new areas of regional and international cooperation along with the implementation of the SendyAction Agenda.

Now, let us look at food processing only once.
