In the last 20 years, 8.50 lakh people have lost their lives due to disasters in the Asia-Pacific region.
Seven of the top ten countries that have died due to disasters are located in the Asia-Pacific region.
The plight of the affected people was very painful.
But their courage, determination and thinking in order to come out of the crisis inspired me.
The more we trust in my experience under the leadership of the common man, the more we have benefited.
There is a need to support such initiatives and leadership through policy formulation and implementation.
After the 2014 Tsunami in the Indian Ocean, five of the most uneducated countries have enacted new laws to deal with the risk of disasters.
In a few days, we are going to celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
This progress has also been made in advance warning of cyclones.
If we compare the damage caused by cyclones in India in 1999 and 2013, we will be able to understand our progress.
Hence, such a system is now recognized as the best in the world.
We have big challenges ahead.
Therefore, if we are not able to manage this progress properly through planning and implementation, the risk of economic damage and loss of life due to disasters is likely to increase even more.
In this context, I present here a contours of the ten-point programme to reorient our efforts to avoid the risk of disasters:
First, disaster risk management policy should be adopted in every field of development.
In just a few decades, most of the new world's infrastructure will be developed in our region.
We have to ensure that these infrastructure is built in a definite manner to protect us from disasters.
India will work with other partner countries and all stakeholders to build disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
Today, in most of the countries of the region, insurance is available only to the middle class and the upper middle class.
Jan Dhan Yojana has connected crores of people with the banking system.
More than one lakh people have been brought under the Suraksha Bima Yojana, which requires this insurance most in their lives.
But they have a lot of morale and insight.
Fourth, all countries in the world need investment to assess the risk.
We have made extensive use of specific standards and measurements to assess the risk of disasters like earthquakes and have identified seismic zones in India based on them.
As part of this network, various universities will have the opportunity to undertake multi-pronged research and research on disaster related issues.
Social media has brought about a paradigm shift in the way we deal with disasters.
The response agencies are able to communicate with each other at a rapid pace and the citizens are also able to communicate with each other with the authorities concerned with each other.
We must recognize the potential of social media.
But the work has to be started at the local level.
For example, if a fire brigade chooses a school every week, thousands of children can learn about disaster management within a year.
And, in the end, we need to strengthen international cooperation in disaster management.
Different countries have extended a helping hand from different parts of the world after a disaster.
We are ready to work with all the countries of the region to combat disasters.
Regional and international cooperation will encourage our efforts.
In November last year, India organized the first South Asian Annual Disaster Response Programme.
It is this strength of regional cooperation that is encouraging India to launch South Asian satellites soon.
Along with the implementation of the Sendai agenda, we will also welcome new areas of regional and international cooperation.
