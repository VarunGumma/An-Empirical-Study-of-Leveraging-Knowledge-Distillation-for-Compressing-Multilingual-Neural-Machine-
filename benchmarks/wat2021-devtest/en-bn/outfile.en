In the last 20 years, a disaster in the Asia-Pacific region has claimed the lives of 850,000 people.
Among the first countries affected by the disaster, seven are in the Asia-Pacific region.
It was very painful to see the plight of the victims.
But their courage, determination and thoughts inspired me to come out of the crisis.
The more we have reposed faith in the leadership of the common man in my experience, the more we have benefitted.
There is a need to support such initiatives and leadership through policy making and implementation.
Five of the most vulnerable countries have enacted new laws to deal with the disaster risk following the 2014 Indian Ocean Tsunami.
We are celebrating the first ever International Tsunami Warning Day in just a few days.
This progress has also been made in the case of early warning of the cyclone.
If we compare the damage caused by the 1999 and 2013 cyclones in India, then we will realise our potential.
Therefore, such a system has now been recognized as the best in the world.
We are facing a lot of challenges.
Therefore, if we are not able to manage this progress properly through planning and execution, the risk of economic loss and loss of life is likely to increase.
In this context and the context, I am giving a outline of the ten point programme to rejuvenate our efforts to reduce the risk of disaster:
First of all, disaster risk management policy should be adopted in every aspect of development.
In a few decades, most of the new infrastructure of the world will be developed in our region.
We have to ensure that these infrastructure is developed in a definite way to avoid disaster.
India will collaborate with all stakeholders to develop disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
Today, in most of the countries of the region, there is scope for insurance only for the middle class and the upper middle class.
Jan Dhan Yojana has connected crores of people to the banking system.
Under the Suraksha Bima Yojana, lakhs of people have been brought under the insurance scheme, the most in their lives.
But they have a lot of vision.
Fourth, all the countries of the world need to invest in risk mitigation.
We have extensively used the parameters and the risk factors of earthquakes in one place after another in India.
As part of this network, various universities will be able to undertake multi-disciplinary research and development activities on disaster related issues.
Social media has brought about a paradigm shift in disaster management.
This will enable people to get in touch with each other and in close coordination with the concerned authorities.
We must recognise the potential of social media.
But the work has to start at the local level.
For example, if a fire chooses a school every week, thousands of children can learn about disaster management in just one year.
And, in the end, there is a need to strengthen cooperation in the international arena in dealing with disasters.
After a disaster, various countries of the world extended a helping hand.
We are ready to work together with all the countries of the region to combat disasters.
It will further enhance our cooperation at the regional and international level.

About 95 countries in the world export detailed techniques of fisheries and aquaculture from India.

Not only this, it is also possible to produce them in adverse agro-climatic conditions.

I want to ask all these questions.
I am confident that this important step will be taken at the World Food Conference in India.
