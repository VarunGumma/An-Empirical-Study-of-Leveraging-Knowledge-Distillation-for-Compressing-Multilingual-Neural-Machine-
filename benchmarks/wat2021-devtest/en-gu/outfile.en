But I was inspired to see his passion to start a new beginning by coming out of any situation of courage, sadness and adversity.
If I share my experience, we will be able to get the better results if we trust the people's own leadership.
We need such initiatives and cooperation through policies and practices.
Five most affected countries have enacted new laws for disaster management since the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean.
In a day to two, we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.

In India, if we compare the impact of the cyclone in 1999 and 2013, we will see the progress made.
Now this programme has been recognized globally and has been recognized internationally.
There are many big challenges before us.
If we do not manage growth effectively, both in terms of planning and implementation, disasters will cause more damage to economic and human life than ever before.
In this context, I would like to present to you a 10-point agenda to revisit our efforts to prevent disasters and reduce risks:
First, all sectors related to the development process should follow the principles of disaster management system.
In the next one to two decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be built in our region.
We need to ensure that it is built with the best available standards of disaster prevention and safety.
India will work with other partner countries and all stakeholders should partner to build a strong infrastructure for disaster management in the region.
Today, access to insurance is limited to medium and high middle income groups in most of the countries of the region.
Lakhs of people have come into the banking system under the Jan Dhan Yojana.

They also have a unique ability and wisdom.
Fourth, investment should be made in technology that examines hazardous factors.
We have widely accepted standards and standards to assess the risk associated with natural disasters like earthquakes.
As part of this network, different universities can do research in more than one branch on disaster management issues that are most relevant to them.
Social media has changed the way we respond in times of disaster.
It enables disaster management related institutions to work expeditiously, effectively and connect citizens with authorities more easily.
People affected after the accident use social media to help each other.
A specific action plan has to be prepared and implemented locally.
For example, the local fire service visits a school every week in their area and informs thousands of children about what to do when a fire breaks out in a year.
And, in the end, there is a need to establish a comprehensive synergy in international response to disaster response.
In the aftermath of the disaster, people affected by disasters from all over the world are being helped in a big way.
All nations of the Asia-Pacific region must work together to take forward our efforts to build a strong disaster resilient infrastructure.
Regional and international cooperation provides an important strength to our efforts.

Keeping in mind the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we welcome new opportunities for regional and international engagement.
