It is really difficult to see people suffering from disasters.
But I was inspired to see his courage, sadness and passion to come out of any crisis and make a new beginning.
My experience tells us that the more we trust the leadership of the people, the better the results will be.
We need such initiatives and cooperation through policies and procedures.

If we do not manage growth effectively, both in terms of planning and implementation, disasters will cause more damage to economic and human life than ever before.
In this context, I would like to present before you a 10-point agenda to revisit our efforts for disaster prevention and risk reduction:
First of all, all sectors related to the development process should adhere to the principles of Disaster Management.
In the next one to two decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be created in our region.
We need to ensure that it is built up with the best available standards of disaster prevention and safety.

Fourth, investment should be made in technology that examines hazardous factors.
We have widely accepted standards and standards to assess the risk associated with natural disasters such as earthquakes.
As part of this network, different universities can do research in more than one discipline on disaster prevention issues that are most relevant to them.
Social media has changed the way we respond to disasters.
It enables institutions associated with disaster prevention to function faster, effectively and more easily connect citizens with the authorities.
People affected after the accident use social media to help each other.
A specific action plan has to be prepared and implemented locally.
For example, the local fire service will visit a school in their area every week and inform thousands of children about what to do when a fire breaks out in a year.
And finally, there is a need for greater coordination and coordination in international response to disaster prevention.
In the aftermath of the disaster, a large number of people from all over the world are being helped.
All nations of the Asia-Pacific region must work shoulder to shoulder to carry forward our efforts to build a strong disaster resilient infrastructure.
Regional and international cooperation provides an important strength to our efforts.
In November last year, India organized the first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise (South Asia Annual Disaster Management Exercise).
In view of the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we welcome new opportunities for regional and international connectivity.
