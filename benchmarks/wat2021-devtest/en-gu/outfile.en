If we do not manage growth effectively, both in terms of planning and implementation, disasters will lead to greater economic and human lives than ever before.
In this context, I would like to place before you a 10-point agenda to revisit our efforts to mitigate disaster and risk:
First of all, all sectors related to the development process have to adhere to the principles of disaster management.

They have their unique talent and intellect.
Fourth, one has to invest in technology to assess the risk factors.

Social media has changed the way people react to disasters.
It enables disaster resilient institutions to function faster, more effectively and connect citizens with authorities.
The victims of the accident use social media to help each other.
A specific action plan has to be prepared and implemented at the local level.
For example, the local fire service visits a school in their area every week and gives information about what to thousands of children to do when a fire breaks out during a period of one year.
And finally, there is a need for greater coordination, coordination and response at the international level for disaster management.
In the aftermath of the disaster, the entire world is of great help to those affected by disasters.
All the countries of the Asia-Pacific region must join hands to take our efforts to build a strong framework for disaster management.
Regional and international cooperation is an important pillar of our efforts.
In November last year, India organized its first South Asian Annual Disaster Disaster Management Exercise (SAFAR).
In keeping with the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch a South Asia Satellite.
