It is really difficult to see people suffering from disasters.
But I was inspired by his courage, anguish and disaster to come out of any situation and start a new beginning.
If we share my experience, we will be able to get better results than we trust our own leadership of the people.
We need such initiatives and cooperation through policies and procedures.
The five most affected countries in the Indian Ocean have enacted new laws for disaster management since the tsunami in 2004.
In a day to two, we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
The same applies to reforms in cyclone forecasting.

Now this programme has been recognized globally and recognized internationally.
There are many challenges before us.
If we do not manage growth effectively, both in terms of planning and implementation, disasters will cause more damage to economic and human life than ever before.
In this context, I would like to present before you a 10-point agenda to revisit our efforts for disaster prevention and risk reduction:
First of all, all sectors related to the development process should follow the principles of disaster management system.
In the next decade to two decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be created in our region.
We need to ensure that it is built with the best available standards of disaster prevention and safety.
India will work with other partner countries and all the parties involved should partner to promote robust disaster resilient infrastructure in the region or build a centre.
At present, insurance access to most countries in the region is limited to middle and upper middle income groups.
Lakhs of people have come into the banking system through the Jan Dhan Yojana.
Security insurance scheme provides insurance cover to lakhs of people who need it the most.
They also have unique strengths and weaknesses.
Fourth, investment should be made in technology that examines dangerous factors.
We have widely accepted standards and standards to assess the risks associated with natural disasters such as earthquakes.
As part of this network, different universities can do research in more than one branch on disaster prevention issues that are most relevant to them.
Social media has changed the way people react during disasters.
It enables disaster management related institutions to work expeditiously, effectively and connect citizens more easily with authorities.
People affected after the accident use social media to help each other.
Specific action has to be planned and implemented locally.
For example, the local fire service visits a school in their area every week and will inform thousands of children about what to do when a fire breaks out in a year.
And finally, there is a need for greater coordination, coordination, and international response to disaster management.
In the aftermath of the disaster, people from all over the world are being helped in a big way.
All nations of the Asia-Pacific region must work together to take forward our efforts to build a strong disaster resilient infrastructure.
Regional and international cooperation provides an important strength to our efforts.
In November last year, India first organized the South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
Keeping in mind the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
With the implementation of the Sendai Framework, we will welcome new opportunities for regional and international connectivity.
