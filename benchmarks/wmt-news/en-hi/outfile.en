A black box in your car?
While American road planners are struggling with the lack of funds to improve the collapsed highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box that fits your cars dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-cycle and conveys that information to the authorities, has become a contentious issue for the Washington and State Planning Office to revive the outdated system to finance major U.S. roads.
Generally speaking, the boring act of highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of intense debate and lively alignment.
You have collaborated with Libertarian environmental groups to garner support to use these black boxes to the miles you drive, and possibly the location of the drive - and then this information.
The tea party is bushy.
The American Civil Liberties are also very concerned about raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action or not, many states were not waiting.
They are looking at how they can go to a system in the next decade in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes for test drives, some of which are GPS monitoring.
This is really essential for our country.
"This is not a matter of our choice," "says Hasan Ichharat, who is the executive director of the South California Government Union, which is planning to start track every mile of motor-driven in California by 2025." ""
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund is almost bankrupt, funded by U.S. citizens by paying taxes on gas pumps.
Americans no longer buy as much gas as before.
Now in a gallon gas, the car runs more than ever.
There has been no increase in the Federal Tax, which is 18.4% per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians refrain from increasing the tax by a single paisa.
"" "Gas tax is not affordable at all," "says Lee Munsif, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota."
Their state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test per mile payment system.
"" "In the long run, it will act as the most rational option," "he says."
Wanks call it a mileage based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea has been well received by urban liberals, as it can, for example, in order to change the manner in which taxes can help reduce congestion and greenhouse gas.
The California planners are keen on this system while developing strategies to meet the targets set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (A-PA), also sees the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers at the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
"" "This is not just what is going into the dark well," "said Adrian Moore, vice president of the policy at the Region."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who, in their report in 2011, had the privilege of moving ahead from the Congress towards every mile payment.
The US Senate had approved a $90-million test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of the rural lawmakers, who were representing people who had to walk a lot of miles to go to work or to go to the city on a daily basis, the leader of the House called off that proposal.
However, many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
It has the most interested Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee to the state instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed preliminary trials.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
The I-95 Alliance, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida).
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on cars of 50 voluntary drivers a short while ago, the drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor every step of the vehicle.
"" "The main problem was to worry about the Big Brother and so on," "says Allauddin Khan, who directs the strategic and operational management of the Nevada Transport Department."
This is not what people wanted.
"As the trial progressed, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website:" "It will be very easy to convert these devices to full tracking devices." ""
There is no need to develop a vast, untied technology infrastructure which has to be essentially expanded to maintain a daily movement record.
Nevada is among many of the states that are making all efforts to achieve affordable technology, enabling the state to know the number of miles per day, but not where and when.
"" "If you can do this, people can feel more comfortable." ""
The search for this technology led some of the state agencies to the small California start-ups called True Miles.
The firm was originally not in the business of helping the state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay on their mileage.
However, the device which it is testing was liked by the highway planners as it did not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a fixed time interval.
"" "If you don't track people's speed and location, they will be more willing to adopt this approach," "said Ryan Morrison, Chief Executive Officer of the True Miles."
There have been some major mistakes in these preliminary programmes of the State.
There are also very few ways to do this.
In Oregon, planner is using various options for drivers.
They can opt for GPS enabled devices or GPS devices.
Or they may opt not to take any device again, but may opt to pay the prescribed fee on the basis of the average mills to be fixed by the residents of the State.
Other locations expect this determination to be sold to concerned citizens by providing more facilities than the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also have the facility of paying parking meter fee, which will provide insurance as per their drive, and create real time speed data collection from other drivers who will be able to avoid traffic.
"The city planning document states," "Motorists will be attracted to participate because of the benefits it brings." ""
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps the whole discussion on miles of payments is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay region has said that the Congress can deal with the problem of the insolvency highway trust fund very easily by increasing the gas tax.
The drivers of hybrid or other cars can also be charged with an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they pay their due.
"" "When aspirin can be used, what is the need for cataract surgery," "said Randy Rentscheller, Director of the Commission's Legislative and Public Affairs."
If we do so, crores of car drivers will be concerned about their own privacy and many other things.
According to police, he died due to suffocation.

However, he did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his greetings to the newlyweds.
The couple got married on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, a 28-year-old woman, who was 50 years younger than her, was engaged to Francesca Pascal.
In order to avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi was the basis of loneliness behind his decision.

The Supreme Court on Friday acquitted self-styled godman Asaram in a rape case.
In the media coverage, Asarams plea, he is being projected as a child suckle, but the court rejected his plea for a stay on the media coverage.
A bench headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order the media to bar him from reporting on the matter, saying he had seen every word that was reported in the media and had no reason to interfere in it.
How can we stop them when they are receiving information from the police and others?
Earlier, Asarams counsel had accused the media of exaggerating the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
Who should they file a case against, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they had more options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asarams plea seeking a stay on the media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the largest ever TDS theft case.
The group manager of the mall deducted TDS and paid to the respective financial institutions, but did not make the payment to the government exchequer.
By doing so, he continued to deposit the TDS amount with himself.
The group was raided by an investigation team from Mumbai on October 17 in collaboration with the Jaipur investigation team.
Further investigation revealed that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
This is the reason why the TDS team had launched on the group on Thursday.
The group of the mall operator was raided and surveyed about 15 days ago.
Angry over the action, the trader has made it clear to the Income Tax Department officials that he is not yet willing to pay the TDS.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting and taking action.
Officials investigating the matter have clarified that in case of non-payment, action will be taken for recovery by sealing the account.
In view of Diwali, the demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of substandard and fake invoices increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweetness more shiny, colourful and sweet, which is hazardous to health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration (DDA) has launched a drive against the use of spice and chemicals.
The department seized a flour of Rs 70,000 from Madhya Pradesh and gram of Rs 5,000 from Quetta Colony.
As the demand for sweets has increased in the market, the demand for substandard flour from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received information about the foul smell of garbage from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The consignment is being imported from transport garages to Nagpur.
The department has seized the money and it is said to be worth Rs 70,000.
No one was afraid of action.
The department destroyed it as undeclared assets.
The department conducted a raid at Jitender Caters in Quetta Colony and recovered around Rs 5,000 from his possession.
Sodium hydrosulphate was used for flattened and for longer durability.
The samples will be sent to lab for testing.
Joint Commissioner of the department SS Deshmukh said that the drive will continue to arrest the miscreants and the miscreants.
The department has informed that the drive will be intensified in the next few days.
The consumption of these sweets can also lead to poisoning.
The department asked the confectioners to make sweets with good milk, flour.
The department has appealed to the people to be cautious of fake dessert and flour.
He was received at the airport by 42 senior state BJP leaders.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a visit to Bihar to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The yatra is being organised by the BJP to pay homage to the families of those who lost their lives in the Patna blasts.
A total of seven blasts took place in Patna on October 27 during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hunkar Rally.
The intention of the terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally to cause more and more casualties and create panic atmosphere in the state.
The terrorists did not succeed, but six people were killed in the blasts.
All of them were declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party leaders, who had gone on a yatra from his village, on Thursday.
On November 5, all their ashes will flow together into the Ganga in Patna.
This is part of the Yatra.
The film stars Narendra Modi in the lead role.
They will be visiting the villages of the victims of the blasts from 7 am on Saturday.
He will also present a cheque of Rs. 5 each to the families of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced its financial assistance.
Buoyed by their thrilling win in the last game, India will aim to win the series when they take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two consecutive ODIs were washed out due to rain, India needed to win the Nagpur ODI to retain the series.
India have achieved the target of 350 runs twice in the series and the onus will be on the batsmen to cross the line once again.
Indian batting is at its peak and the bigger target is also proving to be a boundary.
Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, K L Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Shivam Dube, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur and Mohammed Shami.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got an opening pair that is making the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, they had a brilliant opening partnership to give Virat Kohli a chance to play without any pressure.
Virat Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest modern-day batsmen in the world.
In fact, many cricket pundits have called him even better than Sachin Tendulkar.
Virat Kohli, who turned 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, of which India have won 16.
He averages above 80.00 while chasing the target and has emerged as the best finisher.
The top three Indian batsmen are in sublime form but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful for the team.
Raina and Yuvraj had failed miserably in the last game.
Yuvraj has also failed to open his account in two matches in the series.
In such a scenario, a good innings in Bangalore ODIs can be a lifeline for him.
As far as Australia is concerned, their batsmen, especially skipper George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
They have also been called in the Test squad for the home series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to ninth.
Apart from Bailey, the likes of Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have done well in the series.
However, Aaron Finch and Phil Hughes are yet to make an impact.
The absence of Mitchell Johnson will be a big blow for Australia.
Johnson, who has done well in the series so far, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes.
Dr Jitendra Singh, member and chief spokesperson of the BJP National Executive, said, Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltration of terrorists into the garb of this sham peace.
Quoting intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement here on Thursday that Pakistan was pushing for infiltration of around 2000 terrorists prepared in its training camps.
He will never allow peace and tranquility along the border.
Pakistan has further intensified after the failure of the separatists to foment trouble in Kashmir.
Referring to the visit of the separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said that ISI chief Lt Gen Zahir-ul-Islam, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leaders, Hafiz Saeed and Syed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be fueled in 2014.
Pakistan has taken this decision very seriously.
The killings of soldiers along the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for revocation of the Army privileges in the state as lethal, the BJP leader said it was also anti-people to say such things till there was lasting peace in the state.
They give a fillip to anti-national elements.
He stressed that statements of leaders demoralising the army, security forces should be stopped.
Snow Dane ready to cooperate with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snow Dane, the US intelligence chief, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the parliament if the US national security agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fails to respond to his activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Bale, called on Mr. Snow Dane in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum to talk about the testimony in Germany.
"The MP said in a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday:" "Although the outcome of my efforts is authentically positive, my government accepts dissent as a defection, and does not provide any protection that is an attempt to criminalise a political speech with hooliganism." ""
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snow Dane said he believes that he is of the view that the international community can persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice include intelligence and government property theft.
"Hans Peter Frederick, German Interior Minister, told the online Zeit:" "If Mr. Snow Dane is ready to talk to German authorities, we have to find ways to make it possible." ""
Relations between the United States and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA has claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has been tapped.
"Thomas Aperman, who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, monitors intelligence." "" "
Mr. Straw Bale, an MP from the Green Party of Germany, posted a photograph of himself along with Mr. Snow Dane on Twitter.
He said he was on a visit to Russia along with two German journalists.
"" "According to a former NSA contractor lawyer, Snowden is unable to go back to Russia if he leaves," "Bailey said."
"If Snow Dane gives a witness in Germany, he will be" "safe" "the MP said."
"In his letter, Mr. Snow Dane said that he" "faced a terrible and sustained campaign" "and was forced to leave home."
"However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by the overwhelming response" "to his work of political expression." ""
The United States, including the United States of America, as well as world citizens, have estimated the revelation of an irresponsible system of extensive monitoring of a public service.
"The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German authorities" "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved." ""
Frontier Airlines to levy Carrie-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to store cargo on its board for passengers.
Frantier plans to start charging for $100 for a cary-on bag in Frontier Airlines and will charge $2 for coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday announced that passengers can keep the entire coach.
The new carry on duty is for the bag in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be made free of cost.
Frantier said that he will charge $25 if the advance payments are made, wait for $100 if the passengers are at the gate.
"" "The $100 fee is to be charged to pay in advance for passengers," "" Frontier spokesman Kate O'Mailey said. "" "
"We don't want to pay it," "he said."
The airlines started charging the first and second screening bags in 2008.
The passengers who are trying to avoid paying the fare as much as they can do in the carari-on baggage that is stash in the overhead coach, it means that there is often less space in this compartment.
The fee is a way to bring down for passengers on the board.
O'Mailey said that this is not really about raising new charges.
It is increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find a place for overhead Bin.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airlines website are not required to make the payment.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for the same bag, while a passenger on the line at a front gate can get a bag free.
O'Mailey said the processes of Frontier's website and check-in are being changed to ensure that passengers are aware of the fare.
Frantier's new cary-on fee will not start by the summer, even though a date has not been fixed.
Passengers often express their dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but airlines prefer them.
They argue that the baggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the passenger service should pay for it.
The baggage fee at Wall Street is seen as a sign that many airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, though not even touched the carari-on bag charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the Carrie-on charges for the first time in three years, and partner Discount Allegant Air later.
"" "Another airline is Wizz Air of Hungary," "said airline consultant J Sorensen, who tracks the add-on."
He said that Spirit 's chary-on charges brings US $50 million in a year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former officer of Midwest Airlines, who recently flew to Spirit and was surprised to learn that passengers had to face an unusual carry bag fee at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was easy," "he said."
I was expecting to grind my teeth and see a fight out at the gate.
"The plane was full and they said it climbed a lickety-split." ""
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
"" "" The passengers who take soda, or juice, can keep the entire compartment, and this free coffee will be provided only once. "" "
It will still run out the water.
The US Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months after the passengers complained that they backed out and followed after any other major airline was there.
This is Frantier's latest attempt to run customers to charge tariffs on their own website if Frontier does not purchase directly from the airline.
Airlines pays online travel vendor Orbitz from $10 to $25 each for such sold tickets.
That is why, instead of all airlines going through an online travel agency, an incentive has been given to operate passengers to buy directly from them.
However, Frontier has moved forward in this area.
In September several times, flying miles from half the distance to the customers who had purchased from these persons from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by 25 per cent of the trip meal.
So, a 1000 miles Frontier Trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seats in advance for passengers only if they purchase directly from the Frontier website.
There is a loyal customer base in his home town in Denver, France, but his business is dwindling and he is losing the money.
The revenue declined by 9 per cent and its flight capacity declined by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
They are trying to fix the finances of the Frontier as part of the sale of the Republic Airlines.
"NSA blames" "internal error" "instead of hackers for website crash" ""
"" "Due to some technical glitches, our website was shut down for a few hours and not because of the hackers," "the mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday." ""
"" "Tonight, the NSA was not in touch for several hours due to an internal error during the pre-determined update," "the intelligence agency said in an email."
This problem will be resolved this evening.
This claim is not true that the disruption was caused by the distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack.
In the evening, online server trekkers found that the website of the NSA was closed for at least six hours, and for some users the site was still unavailable.
An NSA spokesperson told ABC News that there was no deal at all with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one of the activists group has claimed online that they were responsible for blocking the NSA's website by a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that the target website carries such a large number of traffic until the site is closed due to overloading.
This cyber strategy is relatively unsophisticated and the target of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the system.
"The former highly secretive NSA, which was never named" "no such agency," "has been the subject of intense criticism and the fact that a large number of foreign and domestic espionage events in the past few months, has become a hot topic of discussion among the public - after the hijacking and clanking of secret NSA files by Edward Snowden, a former, who has been expelled from the agency."
Due to such a growing controversy about the agency, after the incident tonight, there were speculation that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in harmony with the theme Another Dronacharya in harmony with the Dvapara Yuga and today's circumstances.

Bombardier's profit declines as delivery of aircraft goes down
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 per cent decline in net profit for the third quarter in its train unit and less than that on contract issues in the form of pressure by an aircraft order and delivery.
Montreal based Bombardier also did not come up with an update on the issues of releasing any flight test data for its brand new Caceans aircraft or completing its ambitious flight to commercial service from next September.
About one and half months before the first flight of the test flight, it was flown only three times, the question is whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result has fallen below the forecast and shares have been sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8% sliding.
"The stock, an analyst with Cameroon Dorsen, National Bank Financial, on Thursday downgraded its ratings to" "" "" "" ""
"Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, we are obviously disappointed with the margin performance in transport," "Dorsen said in a client note."
We will get a new order for the Bombardier Cesarees as a progress in the flight test programme.
However, if no new orders are not announcing in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market schedule will be announced.
Bombardier hopes that the aircraft families can now cross it at the end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test flight was unveiled in March and was scheduled to take off for the first time in September after the month of delay.
The prospective buyers look forward to the outcome of the flight test to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner fuel efficiency and possible cost savings, but as the fixed order for the carriers, are in the middle.
403 complete orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudine was confident that the Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time the jet was first put to commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media that the programme was going on as per schedule.
"The test aircraft had lived longer on the ground than expected," "Bowden said in a conference call."
Every manufacturer sets a different schedule.
We decided to take a first flight and do an update period and said what we have done.
That is why everything will happen through the flight programme.
The second remaining part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following:
However, analysts are of the view that customers can resume a Ceasefire after their first flight in 12 months.
Bombardier has said that it will provide an update in the next few months that the service (EIS) schedule was evaluated at the entrance.
"This slow speed of the flight test - though in line with the internal schedule of the Bombardier - confirms our view that the service will be pushed to Q1 / 15," "Dorsen said."

The new research has shown that we work with honesty and dedication in the morning.
I do not lie to anyone and do not feel like stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal aside and move against the rule.
The study was conducted by David Achilles School of Business, Harvard University and the University of Utah.
According to researchers, we prefer moral values in the morning, without work stress, but in the evening, fatigue or high pressure reduces honesty.
For this, two experiments have been done.
He asked some people to indicate the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell that the point was higher on the left or right.
The participants were told that they would be given money if they gave a wrong answer instead of the correct answer.
The experiment found that those who were used between 8 and 12 a.m. did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
While experimenting with people between 12: 00 pm and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers.
The researchers were able to prove that the pursuit of money in the morning did not affect our honesty, but in the evening we cease to pay attention to ethics.
The study was published in the journal Psychological Science.

Cocaine addict gets jail term for giving secret information about police investigation
Basharat Dita, 42, used to inform the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer felt that people could know about his secret drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
The top defence counsel, who told Mr Big about the main police investigation, which he was afraid, would get to know about his hidden addiction to drugs, has been sentenced to three years in jail.
Barasht Dita, 42, after compromising on his cocaine addiction, used to provide sensitive confidential information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough about his drug trafficking activities.
"The advocate, who was nicknamed" "Bash" "and who was praised as a" "top briefcase" "by the criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he had represented in the previous Narcotic trial."
The 32 - year - old Scarborough was seen carrying three cocaine bags at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
"After the cocaine was found in the hair, her wallet, and her credit card, the investigation revealed that Dita was a" "regular user" "of Category A drugs."
During the period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrest of Scarborough and two of his associates.
All the four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation of the Heroine and the cocaine gang that were operating in Lancashire, Cambodia, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others who were sent to jail after being seized by the police for heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million during several raids, and over 200,000 in cash.
Dita, 42, used to inform the criminals as she feared that her cocaine addiction would not be known to the public.
Dita, working with law firm Forbes Solicitors at Blackbeard, was today found guilty in two cases of obstructing the course of justice in the Liverpool Crown Court after three weeks of trial.
He had accepted the possession of cocaine in the previous hearing.
The lawyer's bad time started when the police came to know that he was in regular touch with Ditta over phone since February 2011.
Two detectives chased the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and carrying more than 60 per cent of the cleaning drug under the lawyer's bin in the black golf course.
He was in regular touch with Scarborough Dita on the phone after the possession of the drug, which went out for dinner at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that he had kept a drug there and had nine conversations between him.
"The court was hearing that a" "regular user" "" of cocaine was found to be a "
"Dita was later arrested, but she refused to use cocaine and said she was speaking to the suspected dealer as she was a client and that her discussion was a" "legal prerogative." ""
During his arrest, Dita tried to remove many credit cards by removing her wallet, but was seized, and her hair sample was taken.
In a police interview, he said that he used to run the office from his residence as well as from his place of work, and his client used to call him at his residence for legal cases.
After the main persons arrested, the court said that Dita used to call the main persons of the drug supply chain, some of whom had already filed the case.
"Annie White, appearing for the prosecution, said:" "The criminal lawyer should be the best known about not breaking the law."
Shri Dita is accused of misusing her position as a criminal lawyer, engaging with a very large number of his client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a normal drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been without any doubt legal, as he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limits of the Advocate-client relationship.
He disrupted the police investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Shri Dita was insulting her profession, not honouring her profession.
It drew too close to a certain client, especially Scarborough, and allowed the deal with its independence.
"Dita denied any wrongdoing and claimed:" "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who is not me, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately." ""
"But after the hearing, Superintendent of Police, Lancashire, Lee Helsted, said:" "When Mr. Dita started receiving drugs from organized criminals, he converted himself from a criminal lawyer to a criminal." ""
Due to his cocaine addiction, he made a lot of compromise and became very vulnerable to the objectives of the leading members of the organised crime groups who used it to obtain important information relating to the police investigation.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity, and instil confidence and confidence in the people.
Shri Dita has deceived this belief and tried to escape in his career.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire investigated Mr. Dita, who was also found guilty of three incidents of cocaine possession and now obstructing the course of justice, which shows our commitment to bring the offenders to court.
This matter should act as a warning to the offenders that no person is out of reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Skarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiring to supply heroine, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug trafficking.
On his website, Dita gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his fancy job would be to be a lawyer for a death row client in the US, his dinner to be his guest and his inequalities.
Kenya's Press Condemns the Controversial Media Law
"The newspaper challenged the bill, saying," "This is a dangerous place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is there to prevent Parliament from curtailing the independence of the judiciary in the coming days?" ""
"" "This law is cruel and highly punitive, and we reject it," "said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website Capital FM."
He said that the new Media Tribunal will always be biased as it is part of the Government and that banning content and advertisements will harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"" "I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to them to reject this bill and send them back." ""
"According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will provide the government with" "strict control over the media," "while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya" "" "" "" and that the bill was "" cruel. "" "
The Bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after an attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of documents sent to the attack site, showing them deliberately looting the mall, which angered Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo had summoned two journalists and media persons for questioning, though the summons was withdrawn after a media uproar.
"The new bill provides for a penalty of Rs 2 crore on media companies for Kenyan shilling and up to Rs 10 lakh on Kenyan shilling." ""
In case of non-payment of fine, the Tribunal also has the power to confiscate the property of the violator.
"According to the Daily Nation," "A penalty is sufficient to shake the foundation of most of the FM stations." ""
"It also said that these measures may have catastrophic effects that are described as Kenya's" "vibrant blogosphere." ""
By shutting down the media, politicians know that they can do what they want.
"Nation journalist Muthuma Mathew Kenyan described the media as a major source of control and balance in public life and wrote," "No one will ever know."
"" "When left to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and take us back to a hunter-gatherer era." ""
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced public anger.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejection of deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored about 532,000 shilling months, considered to be one of the highest in the world.

He said that the sanitation system, street lights in the city have completely failed.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre in Panchkula.
He has demanded that the house tax in Panchkula be abolished completely.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said the city had got new councillors and mayors after the municipal elections, but they did not have the power to work.
As a result, the city councillors have become a dummy and the authorities are working on their own.
Sood said that the Municipal Corporation has crores of rupees but all the money is being deposited in the banks in the form of an FD and interest is being charged.
But no steps are being taken to invest in the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
The construction of a dumping ground in Sector 23 has forced the residents of the Ghaggar sector to lead a life of hell for the past several years.
Municipal Corporation officials have been talking about shifting of the dumping ground at village Jhuriwala for the past several years, but people in Barwala area are already suffering from a serious problem.
He said that the condition of health services and education system in the villages has deteriorated.

UN sets new goals to combat poverty
The United Nations is soon going to start working on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
"The Australian diplomat played an important role in advancing the" "Sustainable Development Goals" "to replace the MD that was ending in 2015, just ahead of the Interactive Development Summit that began in Rio de Janeiro." ""
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gillard.
"UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that" "the time has come to rise above national interest." ""
I am very happy that the Member States have agreed to initiate the process and own the process of setting up the Universal Sustainable Development Goals.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals (SDGs), and will be an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will do everything possible to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to achieve our far reaching objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based on the success of the SDGs.
The security concern in Mozambique is a matter of growing strong personalities as a conflict
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo with a statue of Mozambique's founder President Samora, which was turning down on them, chanting of peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace, we want stability," "said the CEO of a investment company."
Fearing the future of her country, she changed her corporate dress with a printed T shirt in Ekpurgali and joined a crowd at the Rajdhani Independence Square on Thursday.
The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo for two weeks has been reported almost daily since more than 20 years before a peace deal.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of a movement supported by the government of the white ruling Rhodesia and the apartheid government of South Africa as part of initially efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Accord, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a full-fledged conflict, but recent events have enthused foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy. Some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Wale, Eni, are likely to make an investment of over $50bn next year.
The ruling Freelmo Party, since 1975, has blamed one another for the major political power, and Ray Namo, for the tension.
Ray Namo says that the government started the latest struggle on October 17 by launching an attack on its members in the traditional Ray Namo Ghar province
The government forces attacked the Renmo targets in the wake of the attack on the former rebels and reported to the Financial Times that Afonso Dhaka Ma, a group leader, tried to kill a spokesman for the group.
The government blames Ray Namo for the trigger, accusing him of attacking troops.
President Armando Zizagiatne has sought to address concerns about the instability.
"" "Whatever be the case," "Mr Zijatana told AFP on Wednesday, he saw himself as a" "" "loser." "" "" "" "
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid a war.
Shri Mazhang was quoted as saying that the Ray Namo 1992 Peace Accord was scrapped but later became a matter of concern.
He told FT that the agreement is not being honoured by the Free Limo
"Our vision is to come back for a negotiation, but seriously," "Mazagon said."
The previous talks between the two sides did not do much to de-escalate the situation.
"It's about two big men (Jeetanah and Dhaka) fighting together," "said Yusuf Han, a lecturer and Mozambican expert at the London Open University."
They are neither good interlocutors nor are they necessarily willing to make concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been emphasizing on electoral reforms, had already said of a boycott of the November municipal elections.
The Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to win concessions and economic loot from the government.
The vote share has declined since 1992, while a new party, a former Ray Namo member, is expected to improve its performance in the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), elections.
Mr. Mazang Mr. Jijhatanko, who is stepping down at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want to give up presidency because he does not want peace, he does not want a transparent election," "Mazhang said."
It is not clear what is the capability of Ray Namo, but he has visited a disruptive hit and run on a major North South highway on police stations and vehicles.
Most of the clashes are in the province of Sofa La, several hundred kilometres north of Zomaputo, which has the host Bira port that relies on export of minerals, including Rio Tinto and Valley.
In June, Rio suspended its experiment for nearly a week after the train threatened to strike on the Ray Namo line.
When asked about whether Ray Namo would be able to replicate this danger or not, he was overjoyed.
"" "Ray Namo" "things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community, Mr Mazhang said."
"" "The government of instability has added to the woes," "says Fernando Lima, Media Cop, the head of an independent media company," "many people are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and recent flooding." ""
"People think that the country is the government and the president responsible for the future, and that it should be one to find a solution to the problems," "he says."
The Sultanate of Oman, a performer, people still need stability.
"No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace, they want free access to roads," "he said."
Children should be taught as models for a way of life writers, myths and legends.
"Thor's stories could show that" "there is no competition to all subtle tactics in cruel power," "while Artemis shows the importance of being a dream."
"To teach many of the myths," "Even far away is wild and in some cases it would not be appropriate to teach," "Cross Lee Hollande advocated a" "careful choice" "" one of the most appropriate actions of age. "
"I find it surprising, in the United States, myths and folk songs are already a part of education," "he said."
I'm advocating this as a plan for twenty two years.
"He has called writers and teachers as" "more instructors" "and this is a" "new turn" "for children, as well as messages as being presented in entertaining stories."
"Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon as well as Penguin, wrote the Penguin," "You may have a lot of intentions, but it will be better to keep it out of sight." ""
Perhaps, an adult writer needs some meaning of hope between writing an adult and an adult writer.
Everything has to come to a simplified or a pleasant end, because it is a natural emotion of good and evil.
And that was said to be submitted, rather than said, it was revealed through a story.
Not showing the old base.
Ghumarwin: Head Constable Om Prakash retired after 32 years of service in the Police Department at Ghumarwin.
A farewell party was organised by the officers and staff of the Police Department on the occasion.
Om Prakash is a resident of village Bhaparal in Bani Bhaparal.
He has done well in his career.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in the US: About a hundred years ago, a humorous playwright, Frank Faye, who worked as the show's master at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to listen directly to the crowd.
Faye's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Designed and run by Caroline Hersh, the founder of Carolines, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which consisted of more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"" "Most of these headliners appeared in the carolines, and became a huge success, to the level where they became very big enough to play at the club," "says Hersh."
We built this festival in a way of continuing to work with them.
This years event included the presence of Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at the Madison Square Garden, Stand Up Up Up for Heroes, which also featured other artists, including Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
As the festival expands, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this years festival have come through non-traditional means, such as on small networks such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
"Nick Kroll made his directorial debut with the Deep - Cable Citcom (FX), the" "The League" "with a football theme, and is now his own comedy central sketch show."
"Jenny Slate has been a cast member of" "Saturday Night Live" "and" "Parks and Recreation," "although she is best known for her hair video series" "" "
Other young and young comedians with different voices, including Croll and Slate, (with a completely different voice), Anthony Jesuit, are the products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg's conversation with Larry David:
Steinberg began to work as a stand-up comedian, but became a noted television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
"From 2005 to 2007, she hosted a show on TV Land called" "Site Down Comedy with David Steinberg." ""
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall in the heart of Manhattan.
"" "The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work." ""
He was telling me that when he was here, he sometimes goes to the street between two buildings and you thought that if I had lost all my money, I would be here.
Oil continues to decline by $96 per barrel
A report showing concern over higher supplies, which continued to decline in oil prices on Friday, is an offset where the hungry manufacturing sector in China.
The benchmark for December delivery was down to US $96.24 per barrel in electronic trading at the American New York Mercantile Exchange for late morning in Europe.
The contract has fallen by 5.8 per cent for the month of October, with 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supplies of crude oil have been weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
More than five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But a suggestion of a strong demand from the increase in activity has revealed that two reports on sugar manufacturing have come on Friday.
This shows that growth is likely to continue to strengthen Chinas economic recovery after a downturn of 7.8 per cent in the last quarter of a two-decade.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude used by US refineries.
The Court has restrained the New York Police Department from taking action on a break and sports policy
A federal appeal court on Thursday called for a judge's order to halt the postponement of the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court of Appeals, Justice Shira Shindler of the US Circuit Court of Appeals, has said that the judges verdict will delay the outcome of an appeal by the city.
In August, the judge ruled in the city of violation of the Constitution in a manner that excludes people from his schedule of detention and interrogation.
The city police department also includes its policy and decision to allot a monitoring to help in changing the associated training programme, appealing for its findings and its remedial orders.
The appellate court heard the arguments on the request migration on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal has said that since it entered into an agreement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a section of the media interview and that the public has done wrong to avoid being in favour of the Model Code of Conduct for US judges, it should be removed from the judge's case, public accountability must be made to criticise the court.
The judge held that the police officers had wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its cease-fire and sporting events.
It has appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes, including policies, training and supervision, and it closes down the most, where some of the campuses have ordered a pilot program to test physically wearing cameras.
In August, New York City agreed to abolish the practice of collecting the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police stay.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
Cutting and sports equipment has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and sport policy has been in some form for decades, but has been recorded that most of the black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to 2011, to an all-time high under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg.
One suit was filed by four men all the minorities in 2004 and became a class action case.
The proponent of the NYPD's break and change in sports events has said that inappropriate behaviour will end with a more credible and effective police force to be deployed and other police can influence the use of the department's policy.
Opponents say that the changes will demoralize the police, but crime, money laundering and no will solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure from thousands of officers over the past decade.
The judge noted that there was no end to the pause and play, which was constitutional, but improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
In a period of seven days, all the participants were informed about a wide range of subjects including tent peeling, flag poll etc.
The responsibility of training is being met in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants take part in the Sarva Dharma Prarthana and spread the spirit of unity.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar, State Training Commissioner, is providing special assistance.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm confidential information
"Former editor of News of the World, Andy Colson, has been accused of using" "phone hacking, and" "" "in an attempt to verify a so-called secret information about his affair when he was Charles Clarke's home secretary." ""
"Prosecutor Andrew Aedes, who told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was joining hands with his" "attractive special advisor" "Hannah Polby."
"The court said the newspaper appointed personal investigator Glen Mulkare to" "track" "the newspaper, but Colson also summoned him and gave up his voice."
"Mr Aedes said," "The prosecution has suggested that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the homes of people and not to watch them, but he puts an article in public domain, to see how people react." ""
He said that NOTW used three methods: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third party consisted of its own editors.
Apparently, he knew of the other way, the nigger.
What about the first?
Did he know about phone hacking?
"He says," "No, we say," "Yes, he knew exactly." ""
"Rumours about Clark's affair were first introduced by the AOTTW's feature desk when a source of sexual interest in Ms. Palby said:" "Don't waste your time, he is with Charles." ""
In August 2006, at least three times the voice tape of Ms. Palby's phone was seized from her home in Mulkare.
The investigators also found entries in the computer of the personal investigator on which Ms. Polby and her sister was named Project.
During the period during which she was being examined, a anonymous call was received from Ms. Palby's grandparents and information about her.
Meanwhile, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup observed the traffic monitoring of Ms. Polby.
"On June 18, 2005, through a whistleblowers, Colson, told him:" "I have found a story that we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles." ""
Mr Aedes said that Colson's involvement in the case was in the parton of other important persons, such as former home secretary David Blancet.
The bench on Thursday heard that Colson had spoken to Mr. Blancet about his courtship with a married woman when he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Colson and Brooks refused to negotiate with others to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkare, Thurlback and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.
The exposition of the NSA on State Surveillance Promote corporate fear.
A German police helicopter crashed at the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, late on a quiet day in August.
On the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a photograph of the roof of the US post, less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media asked BFV to express hope to identify the presence of Listening antenna and indicating an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry and German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
"James Clapper, Director of the US National Intelligence, stressed that the United States would" "steal its foreign intelligence capabilities" "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and not use American companies to enhance their international competitiveness." ""
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has become a whistleblower, began to reveal the treasure of his secrets to the US surveillance, European government and business leaders are no longer sure that the director had not kept his promise.
"" "The US national security agency spans on Brazilian oil giant Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, expressed fears about state surveillance." ""
The final thing came when it was found that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was tapped, possibly a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, the business leaders are also set a possible target.
Snowden has made close cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it will be viable to use these data for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," "says Oliver Grn, President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies."
According to a survey by German companies' consultancy in July, the US is almost now at a greater risk than China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
The leak by Mr. Snowden in all the documentation, there is, however, there is no evidence that the US has so far known the trade secrets of its companies to foreign companies.
The politicians have expressed concern over the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union (EU), and should make efforts to reduce their dependence on the US.
Trade leaders are skeptical.
"" "We should build a German Google," "said someone in the German parliament." "" "
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them up...
"" "This is not the way," "said the president of the German business software company SAP."
If a strong European IT industry wanted it to not die 20 years ago.
Everything is available in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations by Snowden about US technological cleanup and espionage access have proved to be a blow to some companies that previously believed to be the biggest surveillance threat
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing umbrella, where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and hence have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a few 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled their plans to use an US-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining programme.
"Jim Snape, SAP's co-CEO, says:" "We have seen a new question that customers didn't get one year ago -- that's what my data was stored -- and can you guarantee that it was physically in that jurisdiction?" ""
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and must be at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
It has always happened.
"This has been a subject for many years, and through fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed," "says Cart Bank, chief executive."
The Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do too, because it is in national interest to protect our business
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defence system and are a advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, messages are being recorded for a long time, even if it is not possible to leave a shop with a stick, or a laptop called a hotel room.
"" "This is an old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings as they are not used as remote listening devices"
While the German BFV executives are compromising on the risk of overseas trips, it advises them to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones.
The prepaid mobile phones were later switched off.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are at the top of the global market.
"Smaller and mid-size companies often threaten to effectively protect the corporate secret against lack of experience, staff and financial resources, against unauthorised access," "BFV warns in a report."
The US has warned of economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to the French The Washington Post, the US national intelligence was named in February after China with Russia and Israel, which is named in the second tier of Chinese economic intelligence.
"According to a board member of a German blue chip company," "French are the worst"
"Bernard Scorsese, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, says in an interview:" "The services are well aware that all countries, even if they cooperate in the non-terrorist warfare, spy on their allies." ""
No one became a fool.
The parents of a Georgian teenager who was killed in an accident, believe that their son was killed
A Georgian teenager, whose body was found wrapped in a wrestling mat in his high school gym, believes that his son was killed, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
On January 11, Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA, was found trapped in a live mat in the middle of his high school gym.
"Investigators of the Landes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in a" "strange accident" "but the 17-year-old boy's family refused."
"" "He fully believes that his son has been killed," "lawyer Benjamin Kramp, who has appeared for Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News."
He does not believe in the manner in which Sheriff is said to be dead.
"He said that" "he believes that this is beyond the logic of physical law and general intelligence." ""
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse to protect a person or people responsible for the death of his son.
"He said," "He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag"
US Attorney General Michael Mulre on Thursday said he was conducting a formal inquiry into Johnson's death, given that many important questions being unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered by a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference here on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
"" "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal inquiry."
"" Moore told the reporter that preliminary autopsy indicated that Johnson's death was a result of a "" "state obstruction." ""
According to Moore, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death.
There are many questions which need to be answered or confirmed.
Murray also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to summon a criminal in Johnson's death case or investigate civil rights, he would ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comments from the office of Londes County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boys parents say they are hopeful that the video footage will give some indications of his death.
CCDC issues Advisory on Allergy to Children for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies in schools.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the US government as the number of school going children is on the rise.
Now in the US, one in every 20 children has food allergy.
The CDC observed that there has been an increase of 18% in cases of food allergies in children between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines prescribe how teachers and staff should be informed about the food allergies of children, and in case of allergic reactions, how to manage them.
The schools have also been advised to keep a stock of epinephrine, which is the most commonly used to combat anaphylaxis.
The State Legislative Assembly has recently updated the norms so that schools can easily stock up to higher levels of epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children with allergic reactions.
"Children can say," "It feels like something is suckling in my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue," "or" "I am bowing down." ""
"Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose Their" "Sex Undefined" ""
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize a third gender for babies born with vague genitals.
Now newborns will no longer be traditionally male or female.
"The new law does not require parents to declare sex for such children, which allows them to declare the gender" "unspecified" "or" "unspecified" "on the birth certificate of the child."
The new law aims to reduce the pressure on parents who can take gender-specific surgical procedures for newborns and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
"According to BBC, an intersex person had said years later," "I am neither male nor female." ""
I will continue to be an injured, stained calf made by the doctors.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children every year is either male or female.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under investigation of the disorders of sexual development, this is a collective term that is used for abnormal chromosome, ovarian, or abnormally developed sex.
It is possible that Valis Simpson was having intersex.
Gender identity is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best of information available for specifying sex when there is no sex determination and to conduct surgery, if such a situation occurs, to observe the psychological and physical development of the child.
"New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dresher, an expert on gender identity issues, said that Germany's new law" "appears to be a good thing."
Intersex creates moral inconsistencies in children.
"" "Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children do not." ""
You can specify the sex without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a sex develops in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer.
It is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
The report filed before the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as distinct from the transsexual or transgender people, since their condition is not related to the gender, which is neither explicitly male nor female, nor female, nor female.
These features can exhibit secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, reproductive organs such as breast and length primary sexual characteristics, such as the reproductive organs, as well as the genitals and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-heterosexual sex.
"Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to identify" "male, female or" "third gender" "on their official documents."
"In June, the 52-year-old Australian Nori May-Welby, became the world's first" "gender-based" "" person to win the legal appeal to a lifelong "" "" gender status. "" "
According to the Interior Ministry, the German passport will also have a third specification in the form of X for intersex persons in addition to M or s
According to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial in neighbouring France.
"In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed the petition for withdrawal of the" "gender theory" "from school books."
"The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed Germany's law, saying," "while the world is going to be in a position where gender is an option but not sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction." ""
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn also told the baby zone that she would prefer to see the sex determination of the baby at birth.
"" "Raising without additional limitations is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child has to say." ""
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with genitals, both male and female, were known as hermicides, named after the beautiful Greek deity, who was bisexual.
And, less than a decade ago, the medical fraternity considered gender to be slate and then written.
But now a lot of people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that gender recognition is a complex task, and sometimes there can be a mistake from doctors who do not know what to feel about their gender specialization when they grow up.
"" "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called the" "" "psychiatric emergency." ""
When these children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist, you used to call a surgeon.
The current theory of treatment of children with vague genital mutilation was presented by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who considered sex to be productive.
"He coined the term" "gender identity" "and argued how social and environmental indicators determine by interacting with the genes and hormones of a child to be identified as a man or as a woman."
But in a 1966 case, known as John / Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex had accidentally gone with the penis during a surgical strike, to bind the child to it and raise him like a girl.
"" "Mani presented the case as a successful case of transfer, but that did not happen." ""
At the age of 15, the child returned as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
"Dresher said that some doctors are still" "following the same pattern." ""
"But with the advent of the Internet in the years after 1990, these sex surgeons began to appear" "not happy with the result." ""
A similar case was with Montana's 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with the XY male chromosome, but his genitals were vague.
"The doctors did not clearly understand that his penis was short, or that his saffron was large, but he was certain that he could never lead a" "satisfied life" "as a man."
Therefore, shortly shortly after her birth in 1976, her external organs and ovaries were removed and raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"" "I knew I was not a girl." ""
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was about to undergo virology.
But feeling depressed and having some defect, he sought medical records.
This brought him the truth.
I was bound at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he returned to the man, he took the testosterone diet and gave up his breast.
He succumbed to the surgery.
Today, in an organization called Interface Project, he urges people to normalize their perception about intersex individuals.
"However, Anne Tammer-Mattis, Executive Director of the California-based legal group Advocates for the sake of Justice, expressed concern that Germany's law" "" invites "" chimpanzees and frogs. "" "
"" "Many activists feel that Germany's law will move parents to make quick decisions and" "" unscheduled "" "
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We feel that rather than wait, specifying male or female sex is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
"Tamar- Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because" "it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender." ""
"" "Adults should be able to make their own decision on legal sex." ""
The German law relates to specifying it at birth.
This is not a battle currently fought by newborns.
When they grow up, they can take their own decisions.
"But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist, Dr. Erline Bartz, whose daughter has sexual development is a disease, and which helps hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law will" "empower both parents and children." ""
Baratzi's daughter, Katy, was born with male chromosomes, but had a DSD called a complete androgen insensitivity.
Since she had a defect in the androgen receptor, women's characteristics developed in Katie.
She has vagina in her body but does not have uterus or ovaries.
The 29-year-old is now married and has a resident of the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"" "This law allows parents to avoid taking their own decisions in haste." ""
It provides them with a proper understanding and time by some trials before writing, male or female.
In this way, you stay healthy raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy it.
We do not have to undergo surgery in a hurry which cannot be returned.
"" "It brings children into the decision making process and relieves them of the anxiety that motivates them as they do not believe they are doing well," "he said."
Finally, the child will determine with which gender he is more comfortable - and that will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make their own decisions.
A legal awareness camp was organised by the Tehsil Legal Services Committee, Ramnagar, under the chairmanship of its chairman and Ramnagar, Sandeep Kaur.
Students and others were made aware of the right to education and laws for economically backward people.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohan Bhardwaj, and Sarpanches also spoke on the occasion.
A large number of villagers were present on the occasion.
Outlook: Biden Dumping Obamas campaign for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton to be the vice president's replacement for the 2012 ticket.
"The most remarkable of the mystery is the 2012 highly anticipated 2012 campaign," "Double Down: Game Change 2012" "by Mark Halperin."
"The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the top advisers to the President had held" "extensive group sessions and late in 2011." ""
According to the Times National Political Reporter Jonathan Martin, the book provides full details of the main officials' effort to the White House, and the White House, the former White House chief, to find out how the change in his name from the vice president to the former state secretary to the vice president to the poll.
The potential switch was a very secure secret inside and inside the Oval Office of the Chicago campaign.
Only close advisers to half a dozen of the president, including the former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Paloufer, were aware that the change was under consideration.
"" "Double Down" "claims Dale attempted to replace Biden with his own," "despite his personal best." ""
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"Mane, keeping an eye on the scene, said," "And one of them, it was," "Dale told the newspaper."
"You remember, when the presidency was under threat, we were in such a situation that" "Holy Christ, what else will we do?" ""
"" "" Martin told CNN's Andersen Cooper that the election campaign again made significant investments in finding out how much it would pay for the poll, "" Dell said. "
"The campaigns do not spend on voting and focused groups like a peso until they think seriously," "Martin said on AC360."
It is unclear, though, did Obama know that his team was looking for a change?
Martin told CNN that he asked Dailey if his boss was aware of the possible changes.
"While Dale said he" "didn't think the President was aware of the possible change," "the former Chief of Staff acknowledged it was" "possible" "that Obama knew."
"The" "Double Down" "will certainly not answer: will you do a political investigation and get to Obama's desk? Martin added."
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was not aware of the Biden dumping ticket research.
"Probably," "Martin said."
Do you like Glow in the Dark Ice Cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first Glow in the Dark Ice Cream - Jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the marine animal to develop the best breakfast.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and China's confident scientists used chemical brightness to rejuvenate the protein.
Ice cream will enhance the pH level of the protein by reacting with the tongue that it eats and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says ice cream is lit up with the response from the heat of the mouth, that is, the more it will be ignited.
"Charlie, founder of the leigh." "This is an incredible thing, but the initial production of me," "said Charlie."
The protein that we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth heats, the protein increases the pH levels and the ice cream shines.
We have been experimenting for the last few months and it looks absolutely right to share on the Halloween as it has an amazing brightness effect
This may be the most expensive ice cream made, which is accepted because of four times more expensive than jellyfish shone
So each scoop costs me around 140 pounds.
However, the flavour is amazing.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavours with beer, cheese, meat and gold leaves.
But its next composition is going to be even more ambitious.
"He said:" "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream." ""
It's naturally impossible because of the ice crystal that makes refraction over the ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of a latent properties of a jellyfish that has been synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire market in Rani Bagh market was crowded with customers.
Recently, people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.

In the end, we talk about mud.
Charlie Brown introduced the Great Sage when we were children, and a Jackets - a Christmas tree - something that we did when we were young.

The dream of the cracker traders to do business in the firecracker market in the transport area has not been realised.
The traders are stuck in the dumper after the High Court order.
They are no longer able to do business in the temporary crackers market manufactured at Ranjit Avenue, nor are they licensed to do business in the transport area.
The Commission, set up by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, during its visit, declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue as unsafe.
A fine of Rs 10 lakh was also imposed on the Deputy Commissioner, Amritsar, for not having proper arrangements.
In its order, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has rapped the Amritsar Administration for not being able to solve even a single problem of crackers for nine years.
They were not able to get proper space in the city.
Subsequently, proper security arrangements were made and the traders were asked to issue licences for the business in the market.
Though the traders were happy with the order, their happiness was foiled by the police on Friday.
A team of the Assaulah Licence branch of the police reached the market and sold the farm by putting up counters there.
It was impossible to meet the conditions given to them in a day.
ADCP East Gaurav Garg, Aslaha Licence Branch in charge Anoop Kumar and SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the market.
He expressed his dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the firecrackers traders.
Hence, licences were not issued to crackers.
Diwali is yet to be celebrated.
As a result, the traders have been suffering.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Aneesh Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Deshraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni Chatrath said they would stake claim to the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Aggressive crackers took out a protest march from Jahajgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the district administration and the police.
Following this, the makeshift tobacco market at Ranjit Avenue was also closed.
A fire brigade was called in to rescue a missing pope at a mine 50 feet above the ground
Cocker Spaniel Ruby had fled after coming in a small road collision
He was seen by a dog walker trapped in the mine three days later
Fire Personnel Discover the Front Front of the Rock to Protect the Door From Death
After Papi somehow caught hold of the critical hill top 50 feet above the ground, being called by the firefighters, he was blessed with a life of fortune.
Nine months cockroaches, Spaniel Ruby, had fled alone for three days before being rescued from the mine on Sunday afternoon.
His owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, were in a flat mine in western Yorkshire to meet him again, and he thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After his escape after a minor accident, he searched for his missing dog like a turtle, and posted an appeal on social networking sites.
At 2.15 pm on Wednesday, a sharpened dock walker saw Ruby, at an altitude of 50 feet above ground.
A technical rescue team from the Clekhaiten Fire Station reached the spot and pulled it down by the rope to save Ruby and used an abdominal tube to bring it down from the rock.
"" "Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said:" "" "" She was in a critical condition. "" "
It was in the middle of the front portion of the rock, 50 feet from the top and bottom.
He did not do anything during the rescue, it was made of stone.
But now it is good.
After that, she was taking biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
Rather, it is incredible to see a dog.
"Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said:" "Ruby is lucky to have survived."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinary doctor for examination where she was found to be better than fatigue and dehydration.
"Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said:" "It was horrible to see the rescue operation"
At first, I couldnt believe how he got there.
It is amazing to get him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she gets very tired and falls, she would have definitely fallen down.
The fire brigade did an excellent job.
What they have done is indeed a very courageous act.
We are indebted to them, and they were all excellent.
"Mr. Alderson from Kigley also said:" "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire brigade did an excellent job.
I dont believe how he got there.

George Carevan: The EURO Dissolution gave Scott an option
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom
This time, we have been warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join as an independent travel zone throughout Europe as a condition for EU membership.
The passports of Barwick indicate stories about the control of the barwick and the boundary of the hard wire on the walls of the Hadrian.
It is true that the Strathclad Paper described the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it was not described in speculative headlines.
No one explained that the EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their requirements.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen region, Brussels will actually be a cheaper discount for non-compliance Brussels in exchange to get what they want from Scotland.
So, then, a story.
"And the thing that has been stuck for so long." "First of all, I had heard the baseless news about 40 years ago."
However, an interesting point was lost in renarrating this interesting old story.
Why should independent Scotland expect to bid farewell to Europe?
Why buy and sell Yoke from London to Brussels, especially now?
Here are the real European news: The Great, Post-War Plan to Organize Europe, has finally come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe has officially died.
Dedicated teams are gaining strength throughout the EU either to oppose the EU or to close the euro in the form of a uniform currency.
Even in Germany, the European Alternative for Germany, which was founded this year, suddenly came and won nearly half a million votes in the September federal election, thus effectively ousting the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dams).
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
However, the present economic crisis proved to be a game changer.
With the stringent rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project Europe has moved far away due to constraints on national economies by complying with the same currency.
The euro crisis did not have much role in the high budget deficits of national governments - that was true only in Greece.
Instead, the euro system stabilized the exchange rate in favour of German exporters to its members what German politicians wanted to maintain.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the domestic currency, Southern Europe finds itself to be in an underlying loss of productivity as compared to Germany.
The only measure is to reduce salaries and public expenditures which have been encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budget and currency problems, deeper European productivity hurts.
"To provide discounts on consumer spending to French and German energy firms as a result of the" "green" "energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay double for power and four times for gas as compared to the United Nations." ""
This is a crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even all wage freewill in the world cannot save the European petrochemicals industry from the impact of cheaper U.S. shale gas.
As a result, there is a sense of revolt among the people, especially in France, which was once a leading EU fan.
After the war, the top French politicians saw the EU as a measure to keep Germany under control, and Paris to provide a billing at the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, which is ruining the French economy.
Result: The right-wing National Front of Marine Le Pen's right-wing National Front (NF) has won the recent by-elections, pushing the ruling Socialist Party to the third position.
The front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote it is a timely warning to the British Labour that they cannot assume that dissolution to the left will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his newfound popularity among the French Gorans, the working class?
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to form an anti-EU, anti-currency front in the European Parliament.
If, as far as possible, the EU opposition parties do well in these elections, such a group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: Soon the combination of the anti-EU and anti - currency sentiment in Europe will end the euro.
"The euro will not be complete, but it will return to a form like" "(sovereign) states" "that will be supported by General de Gaulle."
Germany and some of its ancillary economies can retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I hope the UK will keep itself away from this project in hopes of expanding its engagement with the US.
However, Washingtons growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland next?
We can choose to remain the territory of Little England (essentially).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels - to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a relaxed European system, provided we have our own currency.
It will be easier for the non-federal states to work with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think of maintaining our economic freedom while walking on the way to Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - notably - the most successful anti-capitalist political campaign in Europe - has won an unprecedented majority in 2011, on the basis of the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's Chancellor, Elystaircase.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this point of time, as it would have to accept the rules of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Childhood: Early Growing Up
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls have attained puberty at a young age compared to white girls of their age.
Physical changes do not mean that youth is near
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be faulted
Experts believe that obesity can be a cause of puberty
Timely youth is not as effective in boys
Pat Etienne, a former correspondent for CNN, is an expert journalist on child health and family issues.
Should the mother be concerned if her daughter starts developing breast and ovaries at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, paediatrician, Dr. Paul Caplovis, an expression of a new trend that is common among American girls.
"" "I spend a lot of time assuring parents that it generally does not show rapid progress towards full puberty," "says Caplovitz."
The direct signs of development, such as blurring of breasts, genitals, and the hair and physical odor of the foetus, appear prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a slight change in the age of the first menstrual cycle.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breast development begins to take at least two to three years in the first menstrual cycle." ""
This is the most accurate testing time for the development of youth.
"There is a debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8 years, it is called" "child-adulthood." ""
In most cases, the process will slow down or cease to be a closely monitored by the pediatrician.
In the event of faster progress, there may be a need for an endocrinologist to examine the possibility of serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
Treatment is to delay premature menstruation and other outcomes: premature ageing of bones, which can lead to underdeveloped growth and maternal mortality.
The drugs or hormones depend on the recommendations for treatment, the age of the child, the rate of growth, and the emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
"Capovitz is aware of drugs but admits," "Pressure on youth can raise behavioural issues, and girls can start feeling different from their peers." ""
Another major problem can be understood as: Parents simply do not want their young daughter to have a menstrual cycle.
"" "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene." ""
"A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, recalls," "It was a shock." ""
Although there were symptoms and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally ready.
She was afraid of her school and returned in shock that her first menstrual cycle was started in her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of premature youth.
However, there is no sustained evidence to suggest that hormones in milk or other foods can be charged with sexual messages in the environment.
Boys, like girls, are getting premature youth.
Caplovis prescribe the rule that the main cause of obesity is the outbreak.
She helped conduct studies on girls in the age group of 6 to 9 years in 2001, which connects body fat with puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to have puberty before their own age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the form of premature youth, from economic conditions to weather and genes, appear to be affected by everything.
Other puzzles: Although boys are gaining facial and genitals at a young age, the trend of puberty is not as clear as girls as they were.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
It is also common in infants and children.
"" "We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginning of youth," "says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Moristown, New Jersey."
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician on how to talk to their children.
"Caplovitz advised," "This may mean to talk before the scheduled time." ""
If you remain calm, your child will usually answer correctly.
The girls with pre-mature development need to be assured that even though it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.
On Thursday, the mercury dropped by 3.1 degrees Celsius.
On Wednesday night, the rain and cold winds made people feel very cold.

People had come out of their homes in view of the rain.
People were seen enjoying the sun in the morning.
With the change in weather, there will be a lot of relief from cold, but after that the sky remained cloudy throughout the day.
Children also came to school wearing sweaters.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature on Thursday was 25.1 degrees Celsius while the minimum was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
It received 7.8 mm of rainfall.
According to the Meteorological Department, the cold will increase further in the coming days.
The controversy over seat width put the big orders of the jet manufacturers at stake.
There is a competition among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the long distance classes of tourist and class seats to fight for this month's Dubai Airshow
The dispute focuses on the width of the economy class seat in long-haul flights, not always the same as that for which the allotted space efficiency is claimed by the latest Jet Airways SAS and Boeing.
The Airbus is expected to offer at least 18-inch (46 cm) wide seat in the economy cabin this week, but it has to be decided by its competitor, Boeing.
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers after the 17-21 incident and the likely recorded order to sell the larger version of the long-range aircraft engine.
How is the rear wing of the aircraft created - especially if the seat is 9 or 10 equal to the maximum capacity claim that the miniature jumbo jets are being designed?
"" "" Boeing said, "" it has built a "" 777 x "" "that will put 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 people in one row." ""
The Airbus is said to compete with the A350, which will take 350 people away from 18 inches to 9 seats.
Aircraft giants often trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, with Airbus 777 X, Dubai is expected to dominate over 100 orders at the event, appealing to the public.
In the recent past, it has been seen that there has been anything since the start of the Vitiyapan War.
"John Lehi, head of Airbus sales, said," "Boeing is also offering long-range flights to narrow spaces from regional turbo." ""
In the form of change, even if people are getting big, the way to sit on the plane has not changed.
According to the US health department data, between the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 and 747 of Jumbo'clock, and the average age of the century was 40-49 years.
According to US health statistics, the average American male has a waist circumference of 39.7 in the 21st century.
"The Airbus said its competitor was sticking to the 1950 seat concept when the average circumference of the new name" "Jet Set" "was narrow."
Airbus said it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional 53 per cent sleep quality in the seat width.
Boeing argued on the Airbus seat measurement figures, and said it did not depend on the manufacturers decision on how the airlines strike a balance between fares and convenience.
"" "Research shows that the width of one seat depends on the experience of more than the cabin." ""
"Boeing cabin expert Kent Crowaver said," "It actually provides flexibility to airlines and what they believe in to do to succeed." ""
"They don't want to tell us who they are benefiting." ""
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers, this is about the elbow room, but for suppliers it is fast an issue that it can affect the income.
There is an estimate of at least $700 billion in trade behind the dispute.
The Reuters report reported for the first time in July, whether the seat layout was really a battle between the new jets.
Airbus and Boeing have claimed that 20 per cent of their new twin engines are functional compared to the leader of that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Air.
The claim of Boeing's performance depends on the comparison between the original 9 and 777 design.
The unit cost is 10 equal to the profit now the comparison has been used.
"" "Boeing's aircraft is taking over more seats to make our products more competitive," "" said Kevin Keniston, head of the European Airbus passenger facility. "" "
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat row cabin is suggested for the current 777 S that many passengers are in favour of a denser layout, which can also travel at a cheaper rate.
"The runway girl network of cabin interior expert Meri Karbi, founder and editor, said," "The 18-inch seat width will be very good for the passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus's trade point is driven by a threat to the proposal 777"
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
The jet sellers across the world should also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
With more rest, all the builders are also offering high density layouts for low-cost airline and regional travel.
The Airbus is offering a 10 equal to the A350, but they say it is not sold.
But, as long as Airbus recently emphasized on a wide range of cabin seats on some of its jet planes in need of more cabin facilities.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly to a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it could deviate from the 777 x sales wave.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Can Eliminate Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the effects of smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
There is a need for further and trials, which may take several years to begin human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal Medical College in New York said initial indications are positive.
"" "We are very hopeful that the strategy of such a vaccine will eventually help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available in the market today," "said Professor Cornell."
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which is designed to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the accumulation of nicotine in the smoker.
In the trial, the vaccinated rats that were later administered nicotine continued to function normally.
"" "But the rat who was not vaccinated" "says the researcher," was "" "" happy, "" "" "an indication that nicotine had reached her brain." "" "
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to feed at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved costly and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is expected to be high as the liver will make the cell an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before the urge to try cigarettes to protect them from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to quit.
They will know that if they resume smoking, they will not get any pleasure in smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which will help them break their habit, he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need for a lot of research.
However, the exact cause of the death could not be known.
In a befitting reply, the forest department says prima facie the death of the tigress is natural.
On Thursday night, forest officials of Ramnagar forest division found the body of a tigress near Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi Nallah.
There were no injury or injury marks on the body.
On Friday, the post-mortem was conducted in the presence of Vivek Pandey, Deputy Director of Forests (CTR), Saket Badola, Deputy Director of Forests, CITR, Dr Kakkasha Naseem, a veterinary doctor of CTR, Bharat and Hema Rathore, veterinary doctor, in the presence of SHO, Kotabag.
According to sources, the internal remains of the tigress are said to be mutilated during the post-mortem.
The exact cause of the death could not be ascertained.
Departmental officials gave a befitting reply to the tiger's death.
However, the internal organs of the tigress have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for a toxicological examination to confirm the toxin.
The Western Circle, Conservator of Forests, Vivek Pandey, said that the tiger's death can only be termed as natural.
There are no signs of poisoning in the body.
However, the area has been cordoned off and a search operation has been launched to ascertain the cause of the fire.
Tripody denies affecting us by Obaid.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joey Tripody will be investigated by the State Carpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joey Tripoli has refused to rule down the request of his political guru, Eddie Obaid, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) detailed the investigation of the case, did Mr. Obaid to a number of Ministers of State for the violation of the lease policy, where two Obaides owned restaurants and cafes, were revived after the end of August 2005
After the evidence given by Lin Ashpoly, former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, the allegation that Mr. Tripod had hidden interests? is now under investigation.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had put pressure on it to initiate public tender for lease.
The leaseholders were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular enterprise, from which Obed earned $250 million annually, was renewed from a tender.
Shri Tripathi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he declined Obaid's request for a change in government lease policy
A copy of the phone call was received at the ICAC in August and September 2007 by Mr. Obaides and Mr. Tripod and Mr. Steve Dunn, a senior officer who came to the Fisheries Department of Mr. Obaides after serving in the Ministry of Ports
"Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheeley asked Mr. Trypodi." "Was the Commercial Lease Policy being discussed in the telephonic conversation?" ""
"No," "Mr Tripod replied."
I cannot remember what was discussed, but it was certainly not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Officials said Israeli fighters launched strikes in Syria.
The Israeli fighters targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed Fox News.
The official did not specify the purpose, but there was at least one purpose.
The Associated Press reported that the target was the Russian AS-125.
Israel has fired at missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can undergo authentication test
"" "The government is considering a" "" "authentication" "" test for foreign workers on 457 visas "" "" "as it aims at expanding a strict action." "" "
The test, if adopted, will be implemented through a set of criteria to prevent 457 unskilled posts in Australia or to be used to evict family and friends in a clandestine manner.
A government consultation paper was issued today, condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, former Labour MP Maxine McCurry said today that it could irritate Australia's neighbouring countries.
"" "Strong rhetoric about" "" foreigners arriving at the end of the queue "" "and" "" Australian people at a time when the unions have called for a safe labour market. "" "
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been given protection and I would not be surprised if some in the region had seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The Consultation Paper outlines 12 measures which were earlier considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendon O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, met officials about the traffickers, but implemented five of the proposed changes, while the rest are under consideration.
"If the" "certification" "criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be examined as to whether the nomination is genuine in a situation in which the nominee is the owner of the visa sponsor or a relative of the person." ""
Professionals may be required to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, as earlier businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees put hundreds of people on work.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee, died of a suspected heart attack this week after he arrived in a refugee boat in Christmas Island.
The man's distraught nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and on Wednesday, after the death of his father, an adult cousin, who was on the same ship.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project in Scotland.
Work by HS2 indicates high speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
"Transport Minister Baroness Kremer said the project would" "unify Britain." ""
"Scotland Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was" "very excited" "to work with the UK government on the project."
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
On completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed links between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which was in talks with the Scotland Transport, directed the HS2 Limited to explore the possibility of further improving rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours.
"According to Baroness Kremer:" "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer." ""
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity to 18 cities in the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected by HS2.
"According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael:" "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
"For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for a" "clear" "return of Scotland to the HS2 network."
Mr. Brown said: High speed rail is likely to have a huge economic benefit for Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire UK.
We are, therefore, keen to work in the partnership with the British Government to explore the options to bring high speed rail to Scotland, generate profits for all and meet the Glasgow Edinburgh line, which is already being planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to review the inquiry report next year with the Ministers of the British Government and take a decision on further course of action.
Aircraft electrical equipment rules to remain in force in Australia
In the wake of the easing of equipment regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers will have to continue to switch off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
"The US Federal Aviation Administration has released options to American airlines to change their processes, so that during important stages of flight, passengers will be able to read the e-book, watch videos or play games on their devices, if they are in" "an aircraft" "mode."
Passengers can do so during a number of flights, but many people do not like being able to access their e-books etc while flying and landing.
Australian carriers are considering a decision that according to which US airlines will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority of India also said that it is considering the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electrical equipment at important stages of flight in Australia are still in force.
"Currently, the CASA does not have any specific regulation regulating the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," "the authority said."
Virgin, who is already in talks with the CASA to expand the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to comply with this change, but has asked for further action on the directions of the regulator.
"" "We will welcome the review by the CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel that it will provide better customer experience as we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our aircraft," "the spokesperson said."
Quantas said it will follow the existing rules.
"" "As per our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during flight and landing, and we have no immediate plan to replace it," "it said."
The FAA decision applies to the US lines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and will definitely consider the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each U.S. aircraft carrier and depending on the age of their aircraft.
The airlines will be required to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio defaults with mobile devices, as well as they will have to amend their rules, training material, carry on baggage programme and brief description to the passengers.
"" "The FAA said it will allow passengers to use handheld, light weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all levels, after verification of their aircraft's viability by airlines." ""
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to discontinue their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper coaches during flight and landing of the aircraft.
Silver of Panbrokers in Singapore due to Difficulties
Janani Amirathlinga is accepting cash from her daughter to pay her school fees at a panshop at the Bendemir shopping centre in Singapore.
"" "My husband and I have bought a house recently, so all our money is stuck in it."
She says, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars ($2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia where domestic debt is increasing - the value-Max where they are doing their transactions - becoming the third pan-shop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Carrying of jewellery is not the only way to get cash - in the case of Ms. Amirathalinga, a $1,300 - but also much cheaper than an unsecured bank loan.
Punbrokers in Singapore generally charge an interest rate of 17 per cent per annum, slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the Panbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit scrutiny or wage proof, and can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are facing hardship due to rising input costs and rise in domestic and consumer credit.
After a strong five years of strong growth after the global financial disaster, and a simple monetary policy in developed economies, the low and middle income families are moving to the pancouver to meet their needs, due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standard & Poors, attributed the rise in domestic profits mainly due to rising mortgage, to a risk factor for Asian banks' lending.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in proportion to their GDP.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP as compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged from a technical slowdown this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuous export slowdown and a decline in consumer demand.
"" "The decisive point is that with rising prices, people from the middle to lower classes [income] will try to increase their income in every possible way," "said Song Sing Won, an economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB."
The historically high prices of gold prices in the last two years have prompted people to mortgage personal properties as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to buy their family's jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items seized at the 200-pone outlet in the city-state are gold.
"People say," "The price of gold is good, let's take away the gold chain of the grandmother, and take it back next month." ""
Thailand's largest pan-shop operator, Ezhimney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much growth in mortgage business that the owners of the outlets in Bendix and 15 others like it, like in Singapore, are planning to expand to Malaysia, not only in their neighbourhood but also outside Asia, says Ya Lee Ching, Executive Director, Values.
The company will fund this weeks listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange (BSE) with 60% utilization of the US $66%.
While some of the discount lenders have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Ya says that mortgage is not only cheaper than other lenders but also does not directly increase the loan.
"" "Consumers pledge things that they already have, and buying individual assets does not increase domestic debt." ""
The social acceptance of panbroking is on the rise to access short-term and secure financial assistance.
It is not that Ponbrokers are used only by financially weak individuals.
In Singapore, rich people also use valuax outlets, mortgaging gold bars or Rolex watches to enable them to make cash payments up to 60% of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
"" "These include the rich who need a short term loan for a business venture or investment, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow requirements," "says Ms. Ya."
Sometimes they just need money in a very short time.

A $325 million rescue package for the health of Taji
The Union Government has emphasized that the ailing health system of Tasmania also has stringent conditions attached to the $325 million rescue package, which will ensure that the state government does not waste the fund.
"Federal Health Minister Tanya Plumbarsec has announced that the Commonwealth is" "taking immediate action" "to address the current crisis due to the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases, and the limitations of the system." ""
The financing to be undertaken over a period of four years was decided in consultation with the Government of Tasmania, an independent Member of Parliament, Andrew Wilkie.
"" "The government has come up with an emergency rescue package, which we are confident will address the specific challenges being faced by the state," "Ms." "
The $325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan of $31 million.
2600 additional surgeries, including orthopedics and cataract surgery, will help in solving previous collected cases.
It also includes funds for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Loneliness, better post-hospitalisation, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of individual electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"" "These investments are in line with the best practices that I have been told by leading doctors to improve the health care system in Tasmania." ""
The Minister emphasized that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the Commonwealth Money, and report every month on where the additional fund is being spent.
A three Member Commission will be constituted to ensure that the service is rendered as effective and efficient as possible by the State.
"Mr Wilkie said," "$325 million will not be very large unless there are real improvements to take Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level." ""
However, he appreciated the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.
I hope that the federal aid package will be very helpful in isolating the state of public health system from the crisis-hit list.
According to the State Government, these additional alternative processes will primarily reimburse the recent cuts.
"But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that todays announcement is a" "band-aid solution." ""
"" "We are here because the Labour State Government has taken 430 million in its health system." ""
You cannot consider the state government taking about half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth of Nations giving $300 million as a good news day.
Mr. Dotton demanded that Ms. Plinberg be assured that not a single dollar extra will be spent on the rescue package.
The translation of Dennis Diderot's novel by Guillaume Nickeloux describes the best production design and duration, but it has gone beyond what it should have been.
In 1760, the novel narrates the tragic story of young Raees, named Suzanne, who is sent by her family members to the convent.
When she revolts, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the self-styled godman Mother Superior, and becomes an object of sexual attraction for the other.
This film never goes into comedy or hysteria - that is the problem.
Due to the firmness of the plot, there is also a risk for the audience to make a boring film.
Dr Munna Singh, Vice Chancellor, CSA has decided to levy entry fee in the garden due to the filth spread in the park.
A 15-day ultimatum has been given to the departments to defuse the deteriorating situation.

During this period, he found more than a dozen employees, including the directors of these departments, missing from his seat.
After the reprimand, he warned of a pay cut if he was found absent next time.
Dr Naushad Khan, media in-charge of the university, said that a pass of Rs 30 will have to be made for a month-long tour.
People will be able to visit the park at a fee of Rs 1 per day.
Work from the system: Files relating to various functions will be placed before the Vice-Chancellor under a system.
Not every employee shall have the right to enter the office of the Vice-Chancellor with his / her file.
The officers concerned will take the final to the Vice Chancellor.
The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons capability
On Thursday, the monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed critical equipment to make chemical weapons and toxic gas to the northern part of Syria, while the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the site where toxic agents are believed to have been stationed.
At the same time on Thursday, the Syrian movement group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, which began about three years ago.
The announcement was made a day before the last date of November 1
"The organisation based in Hague had determined Damascus to combine all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases with chemicals and to destroy or" "ineffectiveness" "" "" "" "" "." ""
The completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria is no longer able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to dismantle the existing arsenal.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1000 MT of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent Sarin.
The announcement comes at a time when clashes broke out in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is the chemical weapons manufacturing unit as well as the collection centre, the UK's Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported.
The movement group, which detailing the death toll through a network of protests in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
This includes 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government said 29,954 were members of President Bashar Assad's military force, 18,678 were fighters in favour of the government and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that the dead included 2,202 Army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Nearly 2 million people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assads military party fought insurgents in Safira for several weeks, many of whom were affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but did not say anything clearly.
This war reflects the threat posed by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short span of time.
"A statement on the OPCW statement, which works in collaboration with the United Nations, said the party" "is satisfied and confirmed to have" "" "and has seen all of the declared critical production and equipment of Syria in the form of destruction." ""
"" "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of the confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit two centres due to security reasons.
"On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centres have been" "abandoned" "and chemical weapons products kept there have been moved to other designated centres, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira was one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"In a statement issued by the OPCW, Director General of the monitoring group, Ahmed Uzumbar, said," "I salute the determination and courage displayed by you in completing the most challenging mission undertaken by this organization so far." ""
This civil war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly a conflict between the government of Assad and its security forces, including members from Shia Islam, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In another development, Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said there was a massive explosion at an air defence facility in Latakia, on the Syrian coast on Wednesday.
The cause of the blast is not known yet, he said.
The police have recovered fake registers, fake seals, laptops and fake registers from the possession of the accused.
The police has registered a case against all the accused.
Those arrested have been identified as Rajeev Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Haibowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghoomar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) fled the scene.
According to the police, the accused, along with the clerk and record keeper Balbir Singh of the registry office, used to collect documents from the records of vacant and old land and then buy new stamp paper and generate fake registry on them.
After that the original registry was disappeared and forged registry records.
Thereafter, the accused used to sell the land on forged documents for crores of rupees.
However, these fraudsters used to take loans on forged documents.
After that the real owner of the land used to remain in police custody.
The accused persons who created fake registry were keeping a close watch on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell fake registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that during interrogation, the accused told police that they had so far produced around 150 fake registers.
According to the police, a case of cheating and forgery has been registered against Rajeev.
Protests erupt in Bali over death sentence for bomb blast accused
The families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the 2002 blasts, have expressed their anguish over the death sentence awarded to the bomber, saying Umar Patel should face the firing.
Patel, who, who had been running away as one of the most wanted persons in South East Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building an explosive device used in the bomb blast.
On parole, he can be released in 15 years.
Umar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounded many.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terror-related charges, including a series of bomb blasts in a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas 2000.
"The prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could have also demanded that the" "destroyer" "who was known as a bomb maker, be sentenced to death."
This decision revived the painful memories of a woman in Perth, Jun Cortn, who had lost her 39-year old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patel and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his ashes, he said that the death penalty should have been awarded to Patel.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
"" "She should be put up in front of the firing squad," "Ms. Courtin told AFP."
I live every day without my grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Soon after 11: 00 p.m. on October 12, 2002, the club was destroyed in a bomb blast in a van parked outside the club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddys bar at the time of the explosives packed by suicide bombers just 20 seconds ago.
"They moved to a month long coma as a result of the bomb blast and" "died" "three times while on life support equipment."
Shri Hughes says that Patak should have been awarded the same punishment as three other members of the Jammah Islamiyya terror group, Amroi, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra, who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be sentenced to death before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, the punishment of 20 years is not enough.
Patel is the last person to be convicted of the Bali bombings.
He refrained from being captured for nearly a decade, but finally, in January 2011, was arrested in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the US military had killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report revealed that Patel was in Pakistan to meet him in an attempt to establish a link between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"" "She did not surrender," "says Ms. Courtin."
Even today, it is not really sad to cause mental agony to so many people.
This decision comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"" "There will be a lot of tears this year."
Patel can still appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Aircraft Passengers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but cannot make calls from cell phones)
The astronauts will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but will not be able to communicate with their cell phones - as per the highly anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
Speaking at a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Hurta said that the speed with which these changes are implemented will vary from airline to airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines, and how they are updating their crew members to collect training booklets and equipment to display the guidelines.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on board the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are one of the airlines that have already submitted their plans.
"" "Based on the scheme status, we can approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," "the FAA said in a statement."
At present, passengers are required to discontinue their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft door closes.
They are expected not to reach the altitude of 10,000 feet by the Captain until they are allowed.
Passengers are required to discontinue their device while disembarking on an aircraft and do not turn it on till it is completely disembarked.
"" "As per the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruption can allow their passengers to use the device while flying by plane, while landing and taking off," "the FAA said."
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft which have been modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are required to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, welcomed the changes.
"" "When the policy is implemented in a safe manner - and we will work with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win situation for both sides," "Glading said in a statement."
"When it comes to this issue, we feel like" "hall monitors." ""
However, surfing, email at less than 10,000 feet by connecting to the Internet, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data, will still remain prohibited, the agency said.
The passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in air mode.
So it will still not be able to interact with friends, an online Scrabble game, the famous event that when actor Alec Baldwin, was playing on his smartphone at the entrance in 2011, when he was refused to turn off the device, he was offloaded by American Airlines.
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc., will still have to be collected as they are concerned about the injury to another person in the cabin.
The cell phone calls will also remain prohibited during the flight.
The regulatory authority relating to phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenken, National Transportation Safety Specialist, CBS News, said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
"" "cell phones are really a serious issue, not only because they can potentially cause disruption in navigation devices, but also because they can cause disruption in cell phone towers when in the air," "Rosener said."
The Industry Advisory Committee set up by the FAA to look into the issue has recommended last month that the government should allow greater use of individual electronic devices.
There has been increasing pressure on the FAA in recent years to lift the ban on their use.
Critic, such as Senator Clare McCasillan, D-Mo, has said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
It is becoming increasingly difficult to enforce these restrictions as the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also indicate that about one-third of the passengers forget to turn off the device.
The FAA began to ban the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when it was reported that there was a disruption in navigation and communication equipment due to movement of FM radio and high technology gadgets by passengers at that time.
The new airlines are more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but have also been designed and approved by the FAA to resist electronic interference.
For many years, airlines have been proposing Wi-Fi at cruising altitude from passengers.
The modified aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Hurta said that most of the airlines should meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emits very low power radio transmission compared to the previous generation electronic devices.
For example, e-readers have a very nominal transmission at the time of page turning.
But transmission prevails when the data is downloaded or sent by the device.
Amazon.com has also been one of those in favour of lifting the restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the Company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-Readers in the airlines and flew for testing of the problems but did not find any such problem.
The FAAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed sentiments about the risk of using the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aviation Passengers Union said that he believes that the disruption caused by the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
The other members of the committee said, There are reports only mentioned by the pilot in support of disruption by the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the committee members recommended that the FAA pilot be allowed to order passengers to discontinue the device while disembarking on the aircraft.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them the facility of common knowledge for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
"" "We are happy that the FAA has recognized that the passenger travelling with pleasure is not inconsistent with the safety, safety and security," "said Roger Doe, CEO of the US Travel Association."
Learning from a series of bomb blasts in Patna, the UT Police is all set to celebrate Diwali in view of security and respond to a quick response in times of emergency.

The bird was released back into the forest by air transport to protect it from North Sea Rig
The bird found hanging from a North Sea oil-rig has been released back to the forest by air.
The bird, Water Rail, was sent back by a helicopter to Aberdeen by the Scottish SPCA before he could recover at his Eloa rescue center.
"" "This water rail was probably the winter migratory bird of Northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea," "said Center Manager Colin Sedan."
It seems that the bird was tired and took shelter at the oil rig.
"He added:" "It was unable to fly again, so we were contacted for help."
The water train had recovered well and was healthy before being released.
Are the upper class of Europe ready to do business with the UK?
The Business for Britain was launched in April and a pledge was taken to bring business together and determine what changes UK's job and prosperity creators want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For that, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of the UK business leaders and asked them what they had about their views on UK business with the EU.
U-Gov consulted 1000 business leaders, who are representatives of Britain's business sizes, regions and locations.
The findings of this survey can be surprising for many.
We found that a large section of businessmen now want to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member states are becoming motionless.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not to engage in the long run to reform the EU's secretive institutions.
When asked about specific policy areas ranging from monopoly regulation to product law, most of the business leaders were of the view that these critical qualifications should come back to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of the Brazilian regulation was much higher than the benefits of being a part of the EU's business sector - even with 40 percent of the traditionally European companies - agreed.
Finally, in the end and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large section clearly wants Britain to move ahead on the path of a trade based relationship with the EU, rather than politics.
"This conclusion, which was seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that merchants were driving a" "meaningful change" "that would give the UK back its lost power."
It has a very high price the deal for Britain and a better deal than 16 per cent vote share in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: This survey shows that British businessmen support his plan to negotiate on the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.
It also pointed out that businessmen expect to renegotiate by making a meaningful change in favour of the UK to make the current balance of power.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly inevitable, as the euro zone is moving towards a closed economy and a fiscal union.
The priority must be to have jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for businesses, it means a new focus on trade and a fundamental shift in the regulation of Brussels.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria a new era
The head of the Gazprom said that the beginning of construction of the South Stream Gas Pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
"" "Today is a historic event: Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest in Europe," "" "said Alexei Miller, president of Gazprom." ""
The project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The South Stream will diversify Russias export routes to Europe.
"" "In Ukraine, where Europe has the bulk of Russia's gas, a contract dispute between the counterfeit and the Gazprom presents a risk to traditional routes," "the officials said."
"Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the" "end" "of the Jewish geopolitical risks associated with transit countries."
After commissioning of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will get gas at a discount rate from the South Stream.
The Gazprom said that construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two employees of YMCA charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord
Two employees of YMCA NSW have been charged with child sexual offences before they were charged against CarringBah Child Care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011.
"However, in its statement before the Commission, it said it" "has never come out with a case of child sexual abuse within its organisation." ""
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about a case in which an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography, and another case in which the YMCA was charged with child sexual abuse in 1991.
"" "He was aware of the matter first, but did not know about the second case," "said Mr Hare, an advocate who assisted the commission." ""
He also admitted that the statement of the YMCA before the Commission that the YMCA has been subjected to an external inquiry and that they have found the YMCA at the forefront in the matter of child protection is also incorrect.
There is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified, and in August this year, the Department of Education and Community, the second lowest in four possible ratings in Quality Audit.
"Mr. Hare, who is 21 years old associated with the YMCA, admitted that the" "management itself" "has failed to ensure that employees are clearly aware of their obligations in reporting on child protection policy violations." ""
Earlier this year, Lord Lord was convicted for sexual offences with 12 children during his two years in the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
However, Mr Hare denied the suggestion that the YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not inform the Lord about child safety violations.
The employees gave evidence of violations that the Lord saw, including spending time alone with the children, basing them personally, holding them in their arms, telling them that he loves them and allowing them to play on his mobile phone.
"Daniel Auckwell, who was under Lord's supervision, and had asked for child protection training, as she was concerned about her behavior, testified that the Lord's supervisor, YMCA, was" "very threatening and hard to get most of her time." "
The CEO said it did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable giving information above their managers.
He said that, rather, their friendship with Lord had misled their decision to inform him about it.
"Mr. Hare said that he had given his view to the YMCA NSW Mandal that" "Jonathan Lord was about not providing text" "for the organization from the incident."
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the Privacy Agreement by the employees was taken by the General Manager, Child Services, YMCA, Mr.
"He said that the aim was to avoid a mix of evidence, but it was not" "over-zealous" "and not executed properly."
Stephen Smallbone, Special Professor of Child Sexual Abuse at the University of Griffith, said that YMCA was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2099 and 2011.
"He said that there were" "serious problems" "in the appointment, inspection, entry, training and supervision of the employees."
The hearing has been adjourned till December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like to have an opportunity to become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom again but he believes there is no chance of making a comeback.
In an interview at night on the occasion of his fifth death anniversary from the Prime Minister's Office, the 59-year-old said that he spoke about various domestic policies.
After demitting office in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, limiting most of his remarks to foreign affairs and his role as a representative of the Middle East group, Mr Blair refrained from discussing British politics.
"When asked if he would like to return as Prime Minister, Mr Blair was presented by Londons Evening Standard newspaper, saying:" "Yes, of course, but that is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
He knew that it would be a challenging competition when a crowd of experts performing for the best horse of the year had gathered at Cardiff.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet even at school and a few months away from taking his first step, this little boy and his pet from the start of the game, Tutu Tafy, of Shetland, easily completed three stages and won the top prize, surpassing him, surpassing his own 30 adult counterparts.
In the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Rudy, near Cardiff, the unbreakable pair of skin-length display, behavior, and style were highly appreciated.
In front of the men and women wearing beautiful bouncers, she wrapped up her flat cap and rolled the ring to her two-year-old toffee.
Fenton was praised by the decision makers for his natural ability to control which is far ahead of his age.
And Toby was awarded the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was gifted a toffee as a gift on his third birthday in March last year, and has since practiced daily with the Tutu of Shetland.
"Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said:" "Fenton and Toby, are a fantastic pair."
He had to face a challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the Gold Cup and the Rose.
This was only the second occasion when he participated in a competition with Toby, and we are all very happy with his victory.
In the best part of this theatre, he felt so amazing that he wanted to take a photograph with him.
The little child from the village of Nentiglo in Nentiglo, near Ab Well, South Wales, has been walking on the footprints of his own anti-Sharon Havells that have been demonstrating horses for more than 10 years.
"Mrs. Howells said:" "The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating and clapping."
He was running on sand throughout the theatre, and despite being so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is a lover of animals he loves horses, tractors and fields, and has raised two chickens he takes care of.
The way he has started, he will be in the exhibition of the best horse of the year long ago and I am confident he will do very well.
"A spokesman for the annual horse show said:" "Fenton is only three years old, but he has to control his tattoo." ""
They are a very good pair.
The decision makers gave away the performances of Fenton and Toby and their performance in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tutu and his rider - the best in this case - Fenton and Toby -.
I am sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped him, he looked very different.
"" "The Chinese Newspaper" ""
A Chinese newspaper that filed an appeal on the homepage to release a reporter guilty of defamation, will be revived, a news regulator said.
The newspaper New Express had made a rare public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But then, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write a fabricated story about a part-time owned company in the state.
"The regulator said that now the New Express has to go through a" "complete improvement." ""
"The order for" "reform" "came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration."
One of the preliminary investigations showed that the New Express of the Yangtze Evening News Group had published a number of fake news about the listed company Zumlain between September 2012 and August 2013.
"" "The editorial management of the New Express was messy," "the regulator said in a statement."
"" "It had decided to impose an" "" "an administrative fine" "" "" "" by cancelling the licence of Chen Yongzhou's reporter. "" "
It had directed the Yangtze Evening News Group to make a complete reform of the New Express, recommend to the New Express to investigate those responsible and immediately revise the New Express leadership team.
Mr. Chen wrote in The New Express several articles blaming the financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zumlion.
After his detention, his newspaper published two cover appeals for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But then Mr. Chen came on state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
"He told state broadcaster CCTV:" "In this matter, I have harmed the Zumalayan as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people." ""
I did this mainly because I was obsessed with money and fame.
I have realised my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a cover apology stating that it had failed to conduct a proper investigation of the report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have confessed to the crime.
Experts say that a confession is made by force from time to time, despite the fact that in the latter half of this year, a law had prohibited the authorities from forcing an individual to convict himself.
The recitation of Shri Hanuman Chalisa will be delivered by Shri Maninderjit Singh Bitta, National President, Anti-Terrorism Front, with 10,000 children at a function to be held at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar Bypass on November 23.
Bitta informed this to the gathering on behalf of the Chief Spokesperson of the Shri Hindu Bench, Shri Pawan Dang and Shri Ashwani Katyal, who was also present on the occasion.
He appreciated the efforts made by the Shri Hindu Nyaya Peeth to connect children with the eternal culture.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to provide religious education to the children, including secular education.
US - Mexico gets its own railway in drug tunnel
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the US and Mexico has been found with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
US officials have described the four-ft, three-foot tunnel, as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is about six football pitches in a curved length that connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is full of warehouses which make it easier to hide the truck being loaded.
Officials said it was closed before a drug could pass through the tunnel.
According to court records, the authorities have seized eight tonnes of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the search of the tunnel.
Three persons, who were working as drivers, were accused of possessing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, he can be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment to life imprisonment.
In Nogles, Arizona, smugglers take advantage of the huge underground drainage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major highway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the Maryjuana crop in Central Mexico, which the drug mafia groups are capable of delivering the product at a rapid pace.
In 2010, authorities found a line of about 700 yards equipped with rail tracks, extending from a home in Tijuana to the San Diego warehouse.
On the other hand, Congress candidate from Sarhul Ram Bhagat filed his nomination.

UK Police sends extradition notice to Assange
The British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London.
"Scotland Yard said he has sent a" "surrender notice" "to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he will have to appear in the police station, and added that he will be responsible for his arrest if he fails to do so."
Assange, who is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences, as well as his options under British law came to an end when the Supreme Court had rejected his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the US, he had asked for asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London on June 19, asking for political asylum in South America.
"A Scotland Yard has sent a" "surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange for which he was required to appear at the police station on the date and time that we had selected," "a spokesperson said."
He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that United States would be extradited from Sweden to face possible espionage charges, due to the release of over 250,000 US diplomats on the anti-clandestine website called Wikileaks.

Tax on Foreign Property Owners will bring an end to the artificial condition of London
The Finance Department has taken into account the provisions of the CGST measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had proposed stamp duty at the rate of 7% for households with a value of more than 2% than an individual who preferring to have a house in a company.
The stamp duty received from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea in 2012 / 13 was 708 million, which is already higher than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and the cities of North East.
"" "After the hike in stamp duty of high-value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that a high value property has no relation to the effect of the outdated council tax system." ""
"He added," "But this move can make some foreign investors quiet to buy property in London and are reluctant to sell to existing owners"
In Prime Property, Rich Southwest London, the top 5 to 10% of the housing market, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has registered a record 11.8% growth last year.
"" The prices of central London continued to rise by 5.6 per cent every year, but appeared to be slightly lower than the "" domestic market "" as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent). "
The scientists have further highlighted the link between dog tail movements and its mood.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs move their eggs more to the right (from the point of view of dogs), while restless dogs mainly move their tail to the left.
But now scientists say fellow dogs can identify this subtle difference in the tail and react.
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.
"" "In humans, it is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are involved in a different way in the excitement that produces positive or negative emotions," "said neurologist professor at the University of Trento."
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He said that dogs, like humans, were responsible for the right side of the brain to the left hand side and the opposite sequence, and two hemissaries played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilaterally shaken by other dogs, the researchers looked at other dogs.
He measured the heart beats of the pet dogs and analysed their behaviour.
It may not take much time to understand why their tail is sometimes tilted on one side or the other.
"Professor Vellartigra said:" "We introduced dogs with the films of dogs in the realistic version to deal with other confusing issues, and we could see the tail movement and present the tail to the left or right." ""
When the animals saw a stray dog moving his tail right (from the point of view of the dog), they were completely relaxed.
But when he saw the tail moving mainly to the left (from the point of view of the dog), his heartbeat grew and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellaratigra, he does not feel that dogs were deliberately interacting with each other through these actions.
Instead, they feel that the dogs have learned from their own experience what they should be concerned about and who should not.
"He said:" "If you have met other dogs many times, and if they continuously move their tail one side, it is more friendly, and the right side is less friendly, you react on the basis of that experience." ""
The researchers say that these findings can provide owners, veterinary doctors and trainers with better information about the feelings of animals.
John Bradshaw, a guest fellow at the School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol, said that this is not the first study to examine whether left or right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads right when they see a happy dog.
"In other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, he said:" "Unlike Italian studies, when the robot dog's tail was moved to the left rather than to the right, the dog was more likely to get closer than it." ""
He said that this difference was due to the fact that dogs in various studies were not treating animals or robots in films as fully as dogs.
He clarified that the study of the way the dogs react to the real dogs can help.
While there is considerable evidence from various mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more details are yet to be known and dogs are no exception in this case, he said.
However, given the easiest way to record their behavior, it might not take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side or the other.
Arctic Monkey defers Glasgow Gig due to Alex Turner's illness
The Rock Bank, called the Arctic Monkeys, has postponed Giggs in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered a heart attack.
The schedule of the Sheffield group was scheduled to demonstrate at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But her lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced her to reschedule the show.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were forced to defer Gigg at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on his official website, Arctic Monkey said: Following the decision to postpone the show in Birmingham LG Arena tonight after receiving medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys will have to postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
In the investigation, Alex Turner was found to have undergone a groin, and he was sadly unable to perform.

Pope Francis to announce First Cardinal in February
The Vatican on Thursday announced that Pope Francis will form the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals, the Catholic Church, have the highest class of priests, with only under the pope, and that is why they choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his men, who will eventually help him choose his successor.
At present, there are a total of 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80 years, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pope's election - it belongs to a group of 120 cardinal electors.
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardy said that a meeting of all existing cardinals, called the pope, would be held before the new cardinals.
"" "Pope Francis has already decided to announce his decision to hold the pope - council meeting in advance so that it is easier to plan for Cardinal's participation from various countries around the world," "Lombardy said."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of Cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, the number of cardinals with the age of 80 years of their choice.
Valero said the next year's pope meeting would be important as it would be the first papa after Francis was elected in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
It would be interesting to see if the new popes nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance.
In South America, 40 percent are Roman Catholicism, but with very few cardinals.
The Cardinal's Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, which have to find ways to reform the church, will also be the first to be selected by Francis.
Earlier, the pope used to decide for himself everything.
"" "Just now, Francis has selected these eight cardinals to assist him." ""
"He said it was" "possible" "to consult Francis Cardinal."
But we have not been in this situation before - it is absolutely new.
"Valero said," "In general, the pope gives the bishop's position of cardinal, but Francis was" "absolutely surprising - so we don't know whom he will name." ""
GM recalled pickup trucks in the US to fix the seatback
On Friday, according to a U.S. auto safety regulators, General Motors has recalled nearly 19,000 trucks to offset a shortfall in their most of the new 2014 Chevrolet and the GMC Sira pickup truck.
Some trucks may have a defect in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the association failed to comply with the auto safety norms with regard to the seat back, head resistance.
"" "If the vehicle is stuck from the rear, it is possible that the head constable is not able to properly protect the driver, which will increase the risk of injury," "according to a report posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The trucks of GM started being sent in June and, this is the most important vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal.
GM had informed the truck owners about this defect in the latter half of October.
The owner could not review the notification due to the 16-day government ban which disrupted the growth of auto sales in October.
The sales of the Silverido and the Sira trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, grew by 20% in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM had sold 42,660 silverdo and 16,503 Sira pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the stock of GM was up 1.4 per cent at the New York Stock Exchange
Obamas voters
I voted for Obama twice in anticipation of a change
He said Obamas great efforts have been thwarted by the GOP's policy of obstruction
Obamacare website's policy of blockage cannot provide an excuse for drone strikes
The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign reminds us of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books these days.
This is a book about which I think this second year will add to my excitement during the tragedy of the medical school and give me a ray of hope.
"The name is" "the courage to win" "and is a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign."
When I wake up from the patients' beds at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and speech to stop you.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and the newsmen had called off to reflect the historical significance of that time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents preserved every newspaper.
A group of young minds were going to the White House, and the entire country was ready for a change.
During Obama's presidency in 2008, he had 82 per cent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The present truth is a harsh truth, such as coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of the lost opportunity.
It really changed after my first vote.
Simply put, none of this could have been imagined.
I attribute Obama a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our forces from Iraq to the conclusion of the 'Do not ask for it' until Osama bin Laden is killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has hindered many of our efforts to move forward: immigration reforms, public option for healthcare, closure of the camps at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But a number of times in which I would have taken my stand in favour of the Obama administration before my colleagues and colleagues, I would have the answer that I could give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The Republicans protest policy is not the answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency (NSA) collecting data about the personal life of ordinary American citizens, nor can it respond to the prosecution of those exposing the government.
It cannot explain the cause of the killing of an American citizen without trial, nor of the limitations of public funds and expenses during the presidential campaign.
"This cannot answer the findings of the report that the White House's efforts to silence the media have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration." ""
And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even three years after it was signed in the Affordable Care under the Act.
I dont know what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could have thwarted the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a precursor to our public discourse as the rival political parties and random events such as the Newtown Massacre will shape up to our public discourse.
However, the examples I have given above appear to be largely elected by the administration.
This saddens you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidacy.
Meet Romney presented a confusing and an uncertain option, which did not appear to determine his policies or his position.
I felt that another term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would meet the expectations that we have been hearing for a long time.
However, while Obamas estimated ratings are less than 45 per cent this week, it has become very difficult to come back in 2008.
I am reminded of their missing promises.
He was reading a part of the book this week, explaining how Clinton did not suffer a major loss because of Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they need to return to the track, and remain loyal to their objectives.
"He said," "I want to get my socks back." ""
We have to remember who we are.
Today, five years later, the President, I cannot agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that PM Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to his ancestral leave scheme
billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to the Maternity Leave Scheme as his daughters can be pregnant and can take advantage of it.
The mining giant, who is embroiled in a controversy over a $6 million carbon tax bill payment, has claimed that he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control the Senate by up to four votes, which can be crucial in determining the reduction in carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
"Mr Palmer said," "In case of paid maternity leave, they may have an important interest in fighting, since if any of their daughters is pregnant, they will have a direct interest to get leave or not." ""
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially announced Mr. Palmer as the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat in Fairfax by 53 votes after his re-election.
Mr. Palmer sought restoration of the counting of votes to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters are Frances and Bridget.
Should the result of the election come two months after our voting?
We have to have a better system.
Why cant we have a system in which we fill our description on the computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6: 30 pm?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencil to mark ballot papers.
This is because, because if a person does not like it, he can erase it?
In todays time, the use of pencil seems absurd.
The Election Commission is studying the options for electronic voting, and has recently released a Joint Discussion Paper with New Zealand.
"The 59-year-old said his policies included the creation of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he" "took his new assignment very seriously." ""
The public office is for public service.
We do not want any other award than the award of history that we can serve the community at this crucial time.
This caused problems for the players.
Addressing the gathering, Bar Association president Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his anguish over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said the rapidly increasing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that the perpetrators are safe.
They have nothing to do with the police and the administration.
Referring to the recent incidents at various places, he said that the safety of the common man can be easily gauged when the society is not safe.
RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Foreign Exchange Department.
Some of the worlds largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Dues Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are collaborating with regulators in the worlds largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended as the investigation into the case, which appears to be a repeat in the Liber Interbank loan fraud case, continues.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that it had received a request for information from regulators this month.
"Two weeks ago, the bank had said," "We are investigating the matter and are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators." ""
Last month, experts in the case had said that the RBS had sent to the UK Regulatory and Development Authority records of India for emails and instant messages received from the former trader.
The trader, named Richard Eusher, left the RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been fired from her current position as the European Head of Forex Spot Trading at J. P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in the city, had gone on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and the UBS, was suspended by the Standard Chartered this week.
None of them have been charged with any wrong.
The quick messaging group of Mr. Yushers includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
The UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation in many Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission - the Competition Authority of India - the European Commission - the Competition Commission of India (ECI), the Department of Justice), the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, Government of Switzerland - and Hong Kong - are investigating the allegations of money laundering against bankers.
HSBC, Citigroup, J. P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted an internal inquiry, or received a request from regulators.
The banks are closely examining instant messages and emails for years in search of clues about any wrongdoing.
The news of the investigative, which has created a stir in the business in the sector that has been one of the top gainers in the trading arm of the investment banks for the past several years, but is facing a challenge this year as low as the currency volatility has led to a decline in the opportunities for the speculators.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying it was impossible to manipulate the huge and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it was not necessary to be true.
"The senior trader said," "The fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own platform by banks, despite the huge amount of foreign exchange purchases, means that" "you can start affecting the market at a slightly lower ticket prices." ""
The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced that he would retire Trader from his Exchange Traded Funds desk in London this week, which had posted a loss of about $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is collaborating with its regulators.
"Credit Suisse said," "We believe that the trader had worked alone, and has been controlled." ""

Supreme Court Supports Obamas Health Care Act
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today declared the health care law in the name of Barack Obama as constitutional.
With 5-4 votes, the judges ruled in favour of a separate order of the Patient Safety and Compulsory Care Act under which citizens would be required to purchase or punish health insurance before 2014 - that it was constitutional under the power of the Government to impose taxes.

It is true that we cannot function without money.
Money is one of the biggest necessities of life, but it is not in our interest to accept it.
Dhanteras is celebrated on the full moon day of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshipped as Kuber, the god of wealth, and Yamraj, the god of death.
Money plays a vital role in our lives.
No money is good or bad.
Our feelings for money are good.
There cannot be anything more valuable than wealth that is used for the welfare of humanity, but the wealth that leads to ego has no meaning.
Let us make money for the sacred purpose and spend it for the sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every individual to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
It should also have a sense of spending on the society, but the tendency to earn an unaccounted collection or Yan-Ken type of wealth destroys our conscience, our personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in the mind.
A part of the money given by you can also become the basis of someones livelihood.
We all have to think of the fact that many people in the society are living in dire straits.
In fact, the Purusharhas been given equal importance to meaning, religion, work and salvation.
Everyone wishes for money and success and according to their hard work, they also get wealth and success.
The same wealth is sustainable with which respect is attached.
No matter how rich a offender may be, he may not be able to enjoy it properly or be of use to others.
If someone else has money, dont worry about it.
It is He who will make the way out of the abundance of wealth.
There can be no greater benefit of money than job creation for others.
Another thing, money is not just in the form of money.
It would also have been the love for your health, character, and others.
Try to become the owner of this money.

The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed a day earlier that there was a scam in the PMT of 2012.
The STF has found irregularities in the roll number of 700 students.
Of these, 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admissions of these students can be cancelled.
After the revelation of the STF, the Medical Education Department has started brainstorming to cancel the admission of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting to see the list of all these suspected students from the STF.
A list will be sent to Vyapam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal opinion on the matter.
Departmental officials say that since 2012, it has been one year for the students who had taken admission, it is therefore, necessary to seek legal advice on the matter.
As the matter is currently limited to the STF investigation, the Medical Education Department officials are not in a position to say anything.
Vyapam director Tarun Pithora said if the STF submits the list of suspected students with evidence, their admission will be cancelled immediately.
Director, Medical Education, Dr Nirbhay Srivastava, however, said that the government has not refused to cancel the admission of students if they were found to be genuine.
According to the STF officials, fake students who joined PMT in 2012 are being investigated.
After investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
It may be recalled that Vyapam had cancelled the eligibility of 345 students who had appeared for the PMT examination in 2013.
Of these 345, the Medical Education Department has so far cancelled the admission of 84.

After the general elections, if the new government continues with a policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, half a dozen states will not get kerosene on these shops.
The states where the sale of kerosene is going to stop include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the North East are also planning to stop selling of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, it will be decided on two grounds to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states.
First of all, the foundation is being laid at a rapid pace in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, in most of the rural households in the country where cooking gas connections have been given, the sale of PDS kerosene is going on.
The Petroleum Ministry has already started preparations in this regard.
The sale of PDS Kerosene in Delhi has already stopped since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota of Punjab has been reduced from 2.72 lakh KL to 1 lakh KL.
The allocation for Uttarakhand was reduced by 70 per cent, while that of Haryana by 40 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there have been no reports of kerosene shortages from these states.
The Ministry is of the view that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The difference between the price of PDS Kerosene and diesel is currently Rs 37.
This promotes adulteration.
In states where PDS sales will stop, oil companies will sell kerosene at full prices in the open market.
At present, oil companies are incurring losses of more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs. 31,000 crore in 2013-14.
The accused used to unearth the accounts of the investors using the trading firm in the name of buying and selling of the shares.
This is perhaps the first time such a revelation has revealed a scam of crores of rupees in the state.
The police is yet to ascertain the identity of the gang, but seven people, including the accused, who is the kingpin of the gang, have been detained.
The gang used to run a fake commodity market called Mettader-5.
The officials of the company used to collect cash from the investors and generate fake IDs on a fake software.
As a result of trading, the shares purchased by the investors appeared to the accused.
It would have been known at what price which shares were purchased.
In fact, no shares were purchased or traded because no demat account of the investors was opened and the shares were shown to be false on this fake software.
Police suspect that hundreds of people were involved in the racket.
An investment of two to five lakh rupees was made in the name of making profits from each investor.
While the main accused, Amit Soni, has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, six others from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dual, any share trading company is required to join the stock exchanges as a trading firm
Only then, the company can do the share trading to the investors through it.
The demat account of the investor is then opened so that he could buy and sell shares, but the company called Mettader-5 did not carry on any exchange or stock trading.
The company had purchased the server for itself on September 24, 2012 citing trading in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people have been lured into the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight traders from Indore have come forward to lodge a complaint with the cyber cell.
They were not transferred to their accounts even after selling their purchased shares in profit.
He started demanding profit from the company officials.
Investors are even saying that the fake IDs issued to them were always shown to be low in the value of the shares purchased by them.
The accused used to fix the price at their own level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
The agents advised people to join the company by luring higher profits.
This was followed by deposits of up to Rs 2 lakh and up to Rs 5 lakh.

BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party while addressing an election rally in Pune.
"" "Sometimes there was a coalition government in many states and at the Centre, sometimes in the Congress, sometimes in the form of communists," "" "Modi said." ""
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
There should be certain parameters in the country.
Which party did it?
If there is a comparative result, the country will not have a question of whether the BJP should come to power or not.
Whenever the BJP has formed the government, there has been an effort to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the fact that inflation was low during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai governments.
The poor man used to get two meals.
But when the Congress or its government came to power, the poor people did not get enough food.
Not a single leader of the Congress, even a single UPA leader, is answering what he has done in nine and a half years.
The media in our country are also unable to reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They are not responding to the media.
Elections are from Lok Sabha, you have to answer to the people.
"" "Modi is being asked questions every day," "" "" Modi said. "" "" "
In a democracy, there should be no ruler in Delhi, not a servant.

A case has been filed against Google, Samsung, Huawei.
The group, owned by thousands of former nortel patents, has filed a number of patent cases against Google, including cell phone makers, which it had defeated in the Nortel Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) on Thursday.
The Rockstar, which had purchased noretel patents for 4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
The charge said these patents also include the technology that matches words found to be searched on the Internet with relevant ads, which are a key part of Googles search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Googles Android operating system, which competes against Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google had put in place an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google eventually proposed $4.4 billion, extending the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel Patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the major reasons for this was that Motorola had a long list of patents.
"" "Despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents in suits at the auction, Google has violated, and is continuously violating"
Rockstar has sought enhanced compensation against Google as it claims the patent infringement by Google.
Confidence in Egypt's First Independent President
Mohammed Morsi has taken an oath, but his victory day has hardly ended the political struggle in Egypt.
"Islamic Mohamed Morsi promised a" "new Egypt" "when he was sworn in as the country's first independent elected president, replacing ousted 16 months earlier." ""
On his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arabia has become the world's first independent elected Islamic President, and the fifth head of state after the removal of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He administered the oath of office to 18 judges of the court in his chair, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
"" "We look forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a new republic," "Morsi said at a formal ceremony on national television."
"The radical group, the Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years of its existence as an outlawed organisation, and which has been targeted by previous governments," "said 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the United States," "Today, the foundation for a new life - full freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen escorted the building and arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11: 00 a.m. local time.
With only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new president, apart from his birthday celebrations, the traffic was also stopped for a short while, so that his motor vehicle's convoy would normally come out of a busy road that would connect the city's center to its southern suburbs.
"Morsi's personal reputation as being ridiculed as the non-charismatic" "empty tyres" "after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamic but also as a candidate who wished to complete the 2011 revolution against the dictator Mubarak." ""
"Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi was sworn in before judges sitting in a wooden panel, saying" "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation." ""
Later, Morsi moved to the University of Cairo, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given an official welcome by the military band playing the national anthem, while he was standing in a cautious posture.
The military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
"On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture hall at the main university there welcomed him with the slogan" "Army and people are one hand." ""
Established as a hub of secular education in 1908, the University of Cairo later became the stronghold of the Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath at Tahrir Square, the starting point of the revolution, which ended Mubarak's autocratic rule last year, and vowed to take back the powers of the president of the military council who was ousted last year.
But, instead of traditionally, by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, they bowed down to the will of the army, indicating that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi 's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular postures.

Schools seek greater focus on Mathematics, Spelling and Grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least a Shakespeares play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British story since 1914.
"The exam will also include" "Not seen lesson" "to encourage more and more studies."
A Joint English Literature and Language Course will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in language and will be very motivated to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow.
It will also transform other key themes next year.
In a separate step, the Controller of Examinations will showcase the changes in the structure of the GCSE with a new grading system, and low syllabus.

Studies have found that English schools devote less time to mathematics 116 hours a year or three hours less than a week during the session than most of the countries.
In comparison, Australian schools provide 143 hours an average of one year to students, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there would be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that the integration of comprehensive mathematics with the subjects into the GCSE-League table with the subjects was likely to encourage schools to provide additional learning.

When the security team was leaving my house, I spoke to the Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring the security, he only said that he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted, Kashmir IGP Abdul Gani Mir said it was a sensitive matter.
I will myself examine how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has been withdrawn.
State Congress chief Prof Saifuddin Soz said, I have no such thing in my knowledge.
If the security of Hasan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned authorities.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore in the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
In contrast to Modi's claims, during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as the Prime Minister (from 1999 to 2004), there was a time when the government did not issue any advertisement on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
"" "Earlier, there was no advertisement on the occasion of the 182-metre statue of Sardar Patel," "" "Modi said." ""
While the DAVP records show that the UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on advertisements.
Asked about the claims made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said the BJP's PM candidate does not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
This was due to the economic slowdown that year, Tiwari said.
However, the expenditure incurred on the advertisements of Sardar Patel is much lower than that of the Nehru-Gandhi family members every year on their Jayanti and death anniversaries.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore on print advertisements for the birth and death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
"When Manish Tewari was asked about the difference, he said," "This should not be seen from the point of view on advertising." ""
Because the price of the advertisement depends on a variety of factors, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of advertisement for that year.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, which those who are opposing are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
He will meet the families of those killed at a rally in Patna on Sunday.
Tight security arrangements have been made in view of PM Narendra Modi Narendra Modi's visit.

Police will keep an eye on the visitors.
The Gujarat Police force, the NSG and the state police will monitor the security.
Modi's security will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions are being raised about the BJP's bone marrow of people who were killed in the Patna blast.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar accused the BJP of trying to vitiate the atmosphere.
Moving forward through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Vale is providing free health care in rural Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients every weekend
There are not many doctors in West African countries. There is only one doctor for 5000 people
Give your vote here or over mobile
Dr. George's Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or anyone else in the top 10 to become the CNN hero of the year.
The winner will earn $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Wells saw his ailing father come to his senses and go to the hospital, who were not adequately equipped to help him.
Jamel Wells was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital, Yonde, in 1981.
Initially, he had only his hand was amputated, but an infection that spread to his brain, and he created a blood cancer, which affected his rest of life.
"" "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Wale continued to visit his father in a crowded clinic and hospitals and receive whatever treatment he could.
"" "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5 am in the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but that does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some may have died while they were waiting.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Wale's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
In comparison, there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many Cameroon residents cannot afford to pay for it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two thirds of the healthcare expenditure in the country comes from the private sector.
Their only problem is poverty.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well was determined to solve it.
Dr. George and his team of volunteers have conducted 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in the compound.
And he started the non-profit organization Escobar, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and a group of about 32,000 volunteers have assisted.
On almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tie the medical supplies from the roof to the rural areas where people require medical attention.
Sometimes luck doesnt favour them.
They have to push the vehicle more than once from the rivers and soil and move forward.
But when they arrive, they truly have the honour of heroes: the best home that can be offered by guests, singing and dancing, and the community.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Well-being, along with a big smile and endless energy.
The next morning his team starts meeting with hundreds of patients.
"" "We are meeting 500 people on each trip." ""
They come from about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get a Baisakhi, donated glasses or a free birth certificate -- this document is required in the school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with spatial anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in the school building, town hall or home. After the procedure, the patient leaves for recovery, and makes space for the next person.
The group generator publishes the operation room and sanitizing equipment, and the well and their volunteers wake up early in the morning on Sunday.
This is a slippery pace, but the village musicians generally help in motivating the group.
"" "They keep playing drums all night to keep us up and continue to do their work."
On Sunday, his team returns back to the city, he is tired, but he is proud of his work.
The group, including Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person said that he would be able to go back to work as he gets free of cost hernia surgery.
"" "This will change the future of me and my family."
Apart from running the weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Whale also works at a private medical clinic around the compound at night.
He said that this is his second job which finance 60% of his unprofitable work and the rest is met with private donations.
"" "I don't know when they sleep," "said Katie O'Mailey, a second year medical student at the University of Dressel in Philadelphia."
They are always in the hospital, or trying to earn money for their organisation, so that they can run these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to participate in Wale's campaign, this is a practical opportunity they will never get in their own country.
"" "In the surgeries in which we are able to get the experimental experience of helping Dr. Whale to capture the device or clean the blood clot," "O'Malley said."
As a second year medical student in the United States, you will never get an opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend from themselves to reach Cameroon, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
However, the couple bear the expenses of their stay and directions after arrival.
"" "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They lead their lives for the organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For the well, the burden of almost identical work is not a problem.
Helping others lead a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that make them very happy.
"" "I am very happy doing this work."
And I think of my father.
I hope they will see what I am doing.
I am doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government is there, yet he needs to answer from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the people.
Modi was apparently responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wanted an environment in which he spoke to reporters and did not talk to them to evade questions.

"In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said that the US spy has" "inadvertently gone far ahead"
"John Kerry, in an unexpected way, has indicated that the US's defensive position on its surveillance program by admitting that its spy" "sometimes goes far beyond." ""
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is guilty along with Barack Obama of being on an automatic pilot in the form of insurgent disclosure to Edward Snowden about his appearance in the NSA's espionage activities.
This revelation has caused a diplomatic shock to the US government in relation to its allies.
Speaking through video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: There is no question that the President, I and others in the Government were really aware of some of the things that would happen with the automatic pilot, because looking back, the difficult years of World War II, and then, of course, it had the potential in 9 / 11.
He has become the first high ranking member of the U.S. government, who has acknowledged that the US spy has crossed its limits, but has asserted that no one's rights have been abused.
"He said:" "In some cases, it has unwittingly gone a long way." ""
And the President is determined to make this clear to the people and is currently carrying out a thorough review so that there is no sense of abuse on any individual.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that though the NSA was striving for good cause, and its surveillance work has saved the lives of many.
"He added:" "We are facing a world where people are ready to fly." ""
There are radical extremism in the world that are determined to drive out people and attack governments.
So what is the problem if you are able to stop it before it happens?
We have saved the plane from really falling, building collapse, and people being killed because we have been able to know in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, the Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday said that US lawmakers will travel to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called US espionage, and will try to explain to European countries the need to continue their anti-corruption efforts jointly with the US.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threat of national security agencies to prevent their participation in counter-terrorism.
"" "For the United States national security interests, it is really important that European countries are with us in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts," "Murphy, who was elected for the first time, President of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations, said in an interview to Washington."
To make it clear to the European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger against the NSA program.
The reports of the NSA recording millions of calls from Europe have brought the relationship with some of the US allies, although the agency's chief said that these reports were not entirely correct, indicating a misunderstanding of metadata to be shared with the United Nations gathered by NATO allies.
Other disclosures leaked by Snowden show that the NSA has done cell phone monitors of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the spying on the neighbouring countries, terming it necessary to do so, saying it was normal for both sides.
Amidst the din, Murphy said his office was arranging a Congress tour which is likely to be held this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both the parties.
The names of other participants will be released in the coming days.
He said the work on the Yatra programme is still in progress.
"While Murphy said the trip was aimed at improving relations, he said that some" "impractical relationships" "had to be abandoned."
He said that European leaders must also be honest with their own people, with their espionage programs that have been used for years.
"" "Although we can revise our monitoring program to better protect the rights of the Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," "Murphy said."
During this weekend, Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland, where he will address the hostility from US strategy to US surveillance activities in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new politics of board change has begun in the municipalities.
Recently, in Sainthia Municipality of Veerbhum district, the TMC was converted into a board due to the change in the party of the Board of Directors of the Congress.
This transformation took place as most of the councillors of the Congress, including the municipal chairman, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors of the CPI (M), the CPI and the Forward Bloc have also taken over the reins of the TMC here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy believes this is a good sign for the party.
He said 10 Congress corporators, including Sainthia municipality chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Biplab Dutta, joined the TMC.
Some Left Front councillors, including the CPI (M), have also taken over the TMC flag.
All of them have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and as per the strength, the Sainthia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the TMC.
Shri Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the roadmap for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including the Congress, the CPI, and the Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
Eligible leaders of any party are welcome in Trinamool.
In the political circles, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) is expected to retain power in the state due to the defection of the Congress councillors in the state of affairs in the five municipalities ahead of the November 22 elections.
Earlier, in the Left Front ruled Haldia and Nadia, the Congress-led municipal board was also an example of the TMC's capture.
In the districts, when the TMC is in power due to defection of the civic body, those joining the party are accorded a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to break away from other parties and join the TMC.
He said those who have broken away from any party are welcome to the Trinamool Congress.
He claimed that under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the faith of the people is growing as a result of which people want to join the TMC.
However, the main opposition party, the CPI (M), has said that leaders at the grassroots level of other parties are being threatened.
People are joining Trinamool Congress in fear of terror.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is a blow to the CPI (M) democracy.
In a democratic manner, a party has the right to expand its base but it is inevitable to question the legitimacy of not a change in power.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in jail in Fucket for wrongly attributing to the assault on a taxi driver.
On June 15, the Fouquet provincial court found Steven Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false allegations against the Thai police, alleging that on Sunday morning, June 10, a local taxi driver along with two other persons had attempted to stop him.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned to the hotel safely after divorces her Australian boyfriend.
When Fouquet was questioned by the police for two days, he confessed to the crime.
He was kept in the local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low security checkpoint on the outskirts of Fucket instead of a prison with adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tux, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to help her daughter.
"Tux told Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the entire family was" "deeply concerned" "about the care of their daughter and wanted to call her back to Australia."
"Tux said," "It has been a worrisome time for us, but we hope he comes back home as soon as possible." ""
Bamford has appealed against the sentence order, and has been granted bail on a large scale.
Meanwhile, in Australia, the report said that she was holidaying at Kreby's holiday in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said that the case of Bamford was being fought by a local advocate in Fouquet, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend its sentence to two years and force him to stay in the adult prison.
Similarly, after the recent killing of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Foucault, Thailand could also be exonerated in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
