Black box in your car?
While US road planners are struggling with lack of funds to improve the collapsed highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box that fits perfectly on your car's dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by the motor-driver and transmits that information to the authorities, has these days become a contentious issue for Washington and the State Planning Office to revive the outdated system to fund major roads in the United States.
In general, boring work like highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of intense debate and lively alliances.
You have joined hands with Libertarian environmental groups to garner support for allowing the government to use these black boxes to keep details of the miles you drive, and possibly the location you drive and then use this information to create a tax bill.
Tea party is a flop.
The American Civil Freedom Association is also deeply concerned by raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states were not waiting.
They are exploring how in the next decade they can go into a system in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorcyclists have already taken black boxes for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring
This is really essential for our country.
"This is not a matter of whether or not we choose," "says Hasan Ikhrta, executive director of the Association of Southern California Government, who is planning to start tracking every mile determined by motorists in California by 2025."
The manner in which we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology for that.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund is almost bankrupt, funded by payment of taxes by US citizens on gas pumps.
Americans no longer buy as much gas as they used to.
Now the car runs more miles than before in a gallon of gas.
There has been no increase in federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4% per gallon.
Due to high gas prices, politicians refrain from even a single penny of tax.
"" "Gas tax is not at all tolerable," "says Lee Munich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota."
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per mile payment system.
"" "In the long run, it will serve as the most rational option."
Wank calls it mileage based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea is being liked by urban liberals, as it can, for example, change taxes to change the way cars drive, which can help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gas.
California planners are keen on the system while developing strategies to meet the targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (A-PA) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
"Adrian Moore, vice president of the policy in the region, said," "This is not just a tax that is going into a blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 had favoured moving from Congress towards per mile payment.
The US Senate had approved a $90-million test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of the rural lawmakers who were representing persons who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to go to the city every day, the leadership of the House put an end to that proposal.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
It has the most willing Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges to the state instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the Eastern Cboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers a short while ago, the drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor each of their steps.
"Alauddin Khan, who directed strategic and performance management in the Nevada Transport Department, says," "Concern about the Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem."
This is not something that people wanted.
"As the test progressed, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website:" "It will be quite easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices."
There is no need to develop a large, unregulated technology framework that must be disseminated to keep a daily travel record of each individual.
Nevada is one of the many states that is making all efforts to acquire affordable technology with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles the car is plying every day, but not where and when it is running.
"" "If you can do it, people can feel more comfortable."
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Miles.
The firm was not originally in the business of helping state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance in which drivers had to pay on their mileage basis.
But the device it is testing was liked by highway planners as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at a fixed time interval.
"" "If you don't track the speed and location of the people, they will be more interested in adopting this approach," "said Ryan Morrison, Chief Executive of True Miles."
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programmes of the State.
There are also very low cost and less interfering methods for doing so.
In Oregon, planners are using different options for drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they may not choose to take any device again, but choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other locations hope that this determination can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more facilities than less on the device.
"In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also have the facility to pay parking meter charges, provide" "payment according to their drive" "insurance, and create a real time speed data collection from other drivers that motor drivers can use to avoid traffic."
"The city planning document states," "Motor-drivers will be attracted to participate due to the benefits it receives."
However, some transport planners wonder that perhaps all the discussion on miles wise payments is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that the Congress can easily tackle the problem of insolvency highway trust fund by increasing the gas tax.
Additional one-time or annual charges may also be levied on the drivers of hybrid or other cars, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their due share.
"" "When aspirin can work, what is the need for radical surgery," "said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs at the commission."
If we do so, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of concealing the belongings of the deceased.
The police have submitted the final report of the investigation.
On August 26, police had recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Daria.
His family had accused his friends of killing him as his mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
In the report, police said the phone and SIM of the deceased were checked and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
During interrogation, the woman revealed that she was given the phone by one of her relatives, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Bagh and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhail had gone to Jhelum to take a bath with Zahid after namaz-e-jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all the goods on the shore, while Ruhail went on the other side to smoke cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhail searched for Zahid but could not find him.
He picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept them for his use.
He did not tell anyone that Zahid was drowning.
Police told the court that Zahid's death was due to drowning and the postmortem has also confirmed this.
However, Ruhail has been detained under Section 404 for concealing facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who is known for his Bunga-Banga parties, has secretly married a 28-year-old girl.
This was revealed by his family friend Marthel Polanco.
According to him, a three-time Prime Minister, Berlusconi is married to former TV anchor Francisca Pascal in her private chapel.
Francisca met Balusconi when she was a teenager activist at the Forza Italian party.
It is the same Francisca, whose relationship was said to be just a pretence with Balrusconi.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bung-Banga girl, Marthel Polanco, has revealed that she was also invited to the secret wedding.
The event took place three weeks ago.
When asked what would happen if the two got married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public function.
The wedding took place at a private chapel located in the house of the former Prime Minister.
Nobody can say anything more.
However, he did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to the couple.
The couple got married on October 8 or 9, about three weeks ago.
She was married to Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman who was 50 years old.
To avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi relied on loneliness behind his decision.
Even in low lying areas, there was intermittent rain.
With this, the cold wave has started in the entire valley.
The minimum temperature in Srinagar was 4.8 degrees Celsius, Gulmarg minus 0.2 degrees Celsius and Leh minus 1.8 degrees Celsius.
Leh was the coldest place in the state.
Meanwhile, the strategically important Srinagar-Leh National Highway has been closed for traffic due to rains and snowfall.
There has been heavy snowfall in the Zojila pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activation of the Western Disturbance, snowfall in the high hills and rain in the lower areas of the valley started early Thursday, which continued till late in the evening.
Normal life was also affected due to the cold.
People remained indoors to avoid the cold wave.
Meanwhile, power supply was disrupted in many areas.
Srinagar recorded a maximum temperature of 13.7 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal.
In Jammu, the night temperature has also increased due to strong winds in the early hours of Thursday.
Jammu recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the impact of the Western Disturbance is coming down and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lotts, director of the Srinagar-based weather department, the weather in the valley is likely to remain dry from November 1 to November 1.
Asaram, who is in jail on Friday on sexual assault charges, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being projected as a blood dracula of children, but the court rejected his demand to stop media coverage.
A bench headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to direct the media to stop reporting on Asaram, saying he had seen every word reported in the media and found no reason to interfere with it.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and others.
Earlier, Asarams counsel had accused the media of exaggerating the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They should file a case against whom, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they had other options.
Earlier too, the court had rejected Asarams plea to ban media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft so far.
The group operator of the mall deducted TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions but did not pay it to the government exchequer.
By doing so, he kept depositing the money of TDS with himself.
The team, which arrived from Mumbai on October 17, had acted in collaboration with the Jaipur Investigation Team.
Investigations in the same series had revealed that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
That is why the team of TDS had started the Income Tax Survey proceedings on the group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, the group of the mall operator was raided and a survey was conducted.
Angry over the action, the trader has made it clear to the Income Tax officials that he is not ready to pay TDS to the Income Tax Department at present.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them.
Investigating officers in the case have clarified that in case of non-payment, the accounts will be sealed and recovery action will be taken.
With Diwali, the demand for sweets increases.
As a result, the sale of substandard and fake mangoes increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colourful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a campaign against fake flour and chemical sweets.
The department seized Rs 70,000 mawa from Madhya Pradesh and Rs 5,000 spoon from Quetta Colony.
With the demand for sweets in the market increasing, the demand for substandard flour from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received information about bringing the dirty mangoes kept in the garbage from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
A consignment of mangoes is being procured from the transport garage in Nagpur.
The department seized the mango, valued at Rs 70,000.
Fear of action did not justify anyone on Mawe.
The department destroyed it as unclaimed (undisclosed) property.
The department raided Jitendra Canters in Quetta Colony and recovered Chamcham worth about Rs 5,000.
Sodium hydrosulfite was used to shine the spoon and survive for long periods of time.
The samples have been sent to lab for testing.
Joint Commissioner of the department SS Deshmukh said that the drive to capture chemically mixed sweets and substandard and fake mangoes will continue.
The department has informed that the drive will be further intensified in the next few days.
Consuming these sweets can also cause poisoning.
The department asked the sweet traders to make good milk, flour and sweets.
The department has appealed to the people to beware of fake sweets and mangoes.
He was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the airport by 42 senior BJP leaders.
Modi is on a visit to Bihar to attend the consolation yatra organised by the BJP.
The consolation yatra is being organised by the BJP to appease the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
On October 27, a total of seven blasts took place one after the other during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in Patna.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to foment riots during the rally so that more and more people were killed and an atmosphere of fear could be created in the state.
The intention of the terrorists was not successful, but six people were killed in the blasts.
The BJP has declared them as martyrs.
Party leaders have been on a tour from his village with skeletons since Thursday.
On 5th November, their ashes will be immersed simultaneously in Ganga in Patna.
As part of this visit, consolation Yatra is organized.
It stars Narendra Modi in the lead role.
He will visit the village from 7 am on Saturday to meet the families of those killed in the blasts.
During the meeting, he will also hand over a cheque of Rs. 5 each to the next of kin of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced this financial assistance.
Buoyed by the resounding win in the last match, India will aim to win the series when they take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two consecutive ODIs were washed out due to rain, India were supposed to win the Nagpur ODI under any circumstances and their batsmen gave them a record victory to level the series 2-2.
India have set a target of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again the onus will be on the batsmen to cross the line.
The Indian batting is at its peak and the biggest target is also proving to be a dwarf before it.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form but the team will also have high hopes from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got an opening pair that is making the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a fantastic opening partnership, giving Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure.
Virat Kohli is considered to be the future Sachin Tendulkar by his performances at number three so far.
In fact, many cricket pundits have even described him as better than Sachin.
Next week, at the age of 25, Virat has scored 17 ODI centuries, of which India have won 16.
Chasing the target, he averages above 80.00 and has emerged as a great finisher.
The top three Indian batsmen are in great form but excessive dependence on all three can also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly flopped in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open his account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, Bangalore can do a good innings of life line for them in ODIs.
As far as Australia is concerned, their batsmen, especially skipper George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
They are also demanding that he be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen at number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
Aaron Finch and Phil Hughes, however, could not make any impact on the opening.
Australia might miss Mitchell Johnson in bowling.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
Dr Jitendra Singh, Member and Chief Spokesperson, BJP National Executive said that Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltrating terrorists under the guise of this pretentious peace.
Citing reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan was pushing its feet to infiltrate around 2000 terrorists from its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace and tranquility on the border.
Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue after India failed the Kashmir issue.
Referring to the visit of separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lt Gen Zahir-ul-Islam, LeT chief Hafiz Saeed and Syed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be fuelled in 2014.
Pakistan has kept its promise.
The killing of soldiers along the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for abolition of Army privileges in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said it was also anti-people to say such things till there was lasting peace in the state.
This is benefiting anti-national elements.
He stressed that statements of leaders demoralising the army and security forces should be stopped.
Snowden ready to cooperate with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snow Dane, a US intelligence informer, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to their activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Bale met in Russia on Thursday, where he has been given asylum to talk about the testimony in Germany.
"In a letter presented by Mr. Snow Dane to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said:" "Although the results of my efforts are authentically positive, my government accepts dissent as a defection, and does not provide any protection that is an attempt to criminalise political speech with hooliganism allegations." ""
Speaking the truth, however, has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believes that he can persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him with the support of the international community.
The allegations filed by the US Department of Justice include intelligence and theft from government property.
"Hans Peter Frederick, German Interior Minister, told Zeit online:" "Mr. Snow Dane has been ready to talk to German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA has claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was tapped.
Thomas Aperman, Member of Parliament who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, looks after intelligence, said that even if Mr. Snow Dane had an opportunity to listen as a witness, it should still be taken up without completely destroying relations with the United States and putting them at risk.
Mr. Bale, a member of the Green Party of Germany, published a photograph of himself with Mr. Snow Dane on Twitter feed.
He said he was on a visit to Russia with two German journalists.
According to the former NSA contractor lawyer, Snowden is not able to go back to Russia if he leaves Russia.
"" "If Snow Dane testified in Germany, he would be" "" safe "" "" where assurances would be needed, the MP said. "" "
"In his letter, Mr. Snow Dane said that he had to" "face a terrible and sustained campaign" "and was forced to leave home."
"However, they said the world is happy and overwhelmed by the widespread reactions" "towards their work of political expression." ""
World citizens, including the United States, as well as high officials, have noted the unravelling of an irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
"The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities when" "the problems of the human situation have been resolved." ""
Frontier Airlines to levy carry on baggage charges
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to store luggage on its flight board for passengers.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for $100 for a carry on bag and will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday said passengers can keep the entire coach.
The new carry on charge is for the bag in the overhead bin, so, small bags under the seat will still be made free of cost.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the advance is paid, $100 would have to wait if the passengers wait to pay as long as they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be paid to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge that," "he said."
Airlines started charging for first and second check bags in 2008.
The passengers who are trying to avoid the fee are filling as much as they can do in the carry on baggage that is the stash in the overhead coach, that means there is often less space in this coach.
There is a way to bring down the fares for passengers on the board.
O'Malley said that this new charge is not really about raising money.
It is about Frontier for the most loyal customers that it has become increasingly difficult to find a replacement for the overhead bin.
Passengers purchasing tickets on the airlines website are not required to pay the same.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a Frontier Gate can get a bag free of cost.
O'Mailey said that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fee before getting the gate.
Frantiers new career-on fee will not start until summer, though a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but they like airline services.
They argue that money is spent on handling baggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
The baggage fee on Wall Street is seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, do not even touch the carry on bag charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc started the carry on charges for the first time three years ago, and fellow discount Alligant Air later announced.
"Along with one such fee, the other airline is Hungary's Wizz Air, which is said by airline consultant J Sorensen, and which tracks add-on fees." ""
He said Spirit's cary-on charges bring $50 million in a year, as estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former official of Midwest Airlines, recently took off in Spirit and expressed surprise that passengers had to face cary-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was comfortable," "he said."
I expected to grind my teeth and look out at a fight gate.
The aircraft was full and he said it climbed the lickey-split.
Frantier is also following the $2 fee of Spirit for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire coach, and give it free coffee only once.
It will still drain out the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge drinks in 2008, but withdrew seven months later after passengers complained and any other major airline followed after being there.
This move by Frontier is its latest attempt to run customers towards its own website to charge a fee on carry on if passengers of Frontier do not purchase directly from the airline.
Airlines pays online travel seller Orbitz for such tickets ranging from $10 to $25 each.
This is the reason why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
However, Frantier has moved ahead in this area.
In September, many often started giving flights miles from half a mile to customers who had purchased from these individuals from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000 miles Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It is also that they allow only passengers to choose their seats in advance if purchased directly from the Frontier website.
Frantiers home in Denver has a loyal customer base, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 per cent and its flying capacity declined by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, as per the financial results released by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc on Wednesday.
As part of the sale of Republic Airlines, they are trying to finance Frontier.
"NSA accuses" "internal error" "instead of hackers for website crash"
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical glitch and not because of hackers as claimed online by some people.
"" "NSA .gov.in was not in touch for several hours tonight due to internal error during pre-scheduled updates," "the intelligence agency said in an email statement."
This problem will be resolved this evening.
It is not true to claim that this obstruction came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack.
In the evening, online server trekkers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is still not accessible to some users.
"An NSA spokesperson told ABC News that there was no" "agreement" "with the agency's internal, sensitive network at all."
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the NSA website by the DDoS attack.
The DOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such large quantities unless the site is closed due to overloading of the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively crude and the aim of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
"The former highly mysterious NSA, which was never named" "no such agency," "has become a subject of intense public debate and criticism in the past months due to the incidents of foreign and domestic espionage programmes that broke out collectively following the theft and discovery of secret NSA files from the agency by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden."
Due to such growing controversy about the agency, after tonight's incident, there was speculation that the incident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
A beautiful expression was presented in line with another Dronacharya narrative in harmony with the Dvapara Yuga and today's circumstances.
In today's context, it was shown in which chains a Guru is forced to walk on the wrong path.
The play was jointly inaugurated by MLA Prabhudyal Valmiki, Vice President of Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh, Chief Guest at the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The play depicted the similarity of the circumstances of Dronacharya of the Dvapara era and currently a professor Arvind.
Directed by Anil Sharma, the play starred Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechan, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vamshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun and others.
The lighting of the play was done by young theatre activist Jitendra C. Raj and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
Later, various awards were presented to literary and cultural personalities on behalf of Apta at the function.
Dr Aslam Jamsetpuri, Head of the Department of Urdu, Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and theatre activist Jitendra C. Raj were also present on the occasion.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi and others were present on the occasion.
Bombardier profit declines as delivery of aircraft
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 per cent decline in net profit on Thursday, in its train unit in the third quarter and as a less aircraft order and delivery pressure on contract issues.
Montreal based Bombardier also did not offer an update on the issues of releasing any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or completing its ambitious program of flying to commercial service from next September.
About a month and half before the first flight of the test aircraft, it has been flown only three times, the question arises whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell below the forecast and the stock was sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8 per cent sliding.
"" "Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, on Thursday downgraded its rating for" "" "field performance" "" from "" "defeat" "" "and the stock is limited over the next one or two quarters." ""
"Weak aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are obviously disappointed with the margin performance in transport," "Dorsen said in a client note."
We will receive a new order for Bombardier CSeries as a progress of flight testing program.
However, if no new orders are being announced in the coming months, the market is doubtful for the programme.
Bombardier expects the airline families to cut it at the lower end of the Boeing and Airbus dominated market.
The first test flight was unveiled in March and took off for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Potential buyers wait for the outcome of the flight test to validate the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as for CSeries, the fixed order is in the middle of 177.
403 complete orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bodyne was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time Jet first introduced commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was going on as per the schedule.
"The test aircraft was on the ground for a longer period than expected," "Bodwin said in a conference call, adding that land testing and software updates were determined during the aircraft interval."
Each manufacturer makes a different schedule in a different way.
We had decided to do a first flight and an update period and said what we have done.
That is why everything will happen through the flight programme.

New research has shown that we work with honesty and dedication in the morning.
He does not lie to anyone and does not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our minds change and we keep the ideal aside and move against the rule.
The study, conducted by Harvard University and the David Nicholas School of Business in Utah, has given interesting facts.
According to the researchers, without stress at work in the morning, we prefer moral values, but in the evening, honesty decreases due to fatigue or pressure.
The researchers conducted two experiments for this purpose.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right.
Participants were told that they would be paid if they gave a wrong answer instead of the right answer.
The experiment showed that the people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the right answer.
While experimenting with people between 12 pm and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by ignoring their principles.
This helped the researchers to prove that greed for money in the morning does not affect our honesty, but by evening we stop focusing on ethics.
The study was published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.

Prisoner lawyer of cocaine jailed for giving secret information about police investigation to Shri Big
Basharat Ditta, 42, used to inform notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer felt that people could come to know about his secret drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
The top defence lawyer, who told Mr Big about the main police investigation, as he feared that people would know about his secret drug addiction, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Barasht Ditta, 42, after compromising on her cocaine addiction, provided sensitive confidential information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough about his drug trafficking activities.
"The lawyer, nicknamed" "Bash," "and who was praised as a" "top briefcase" "by criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after conducting police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous narcotics trial."
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarborough holding three cocaine bags in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
"After finding cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, his wallet, and his credit card, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a" "regular user" "of A category of drugs."
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011, it attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation into the heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Among them were 32 other persons who were sent to jail after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds, and more than 200,000 pounds in cash during several raids.
Ditta, 42, used to inform the criminals as she feared that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackford, was today facing contempt at the Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty in two cases of obstructing the course of justice after a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted to having cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer began when the police found out that he was in regular touch with Ditta on the phone since February 2011 while examining Scarborough.
Two spies chased the suspect and found him coming to Ditta's house and possessing more than 60 per cent purity of drugs under the lawyer's bin in the Black Golf Glove.
After the drug was kept, Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta over the phone, who had gone out for dinner at the Blackern Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that the drug was kept there and there were nine conversations between them.
"It was heard in the court that Ditta was found to be a" "regular user" "of cocaine in the test after she was found to be exposed to Category A drug on her hair, wallet and credit cards."
"Ditta was later arrested but refused to use the cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer as he was his client and said that his discussion was a matter of" "legal privilege." ""
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove many credit cards by removing her wallet, but was seized, and her hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office from his workplace as well as from his home, and his clients used to call his house for legal matters.
After the main persons arrested told what the detectives knew about them, the court said in the hearing that Ditta used to call up prominent persons in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had earlier submitted the case.
"On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said:" "The criminal lawyer should be best aware of not breaking the law."
Shri Ditta is accused of misusing her position as a criminal lawyer, adding too much to his particular client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a normal drug dealer but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without any doubt as he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limits of just-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as far as possible to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Shri Ditta was not honouring his profession but insulting it.
He made too many closures from certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed compromises with his independence.
"Dita denied any wrongdoing and claimed:" "If I had been a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately." ""
"But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstade said:" "When Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, he converted himself from a criminal lawyer to a criminal."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he compromised heavily and became too weak to meet the objectives of leading members of organized crime groups who used it to get important information related to police investigation.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Shri Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to escape his profession.
Shri Ditta was investigated by the Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire, which found him guilty of three incidents of cocaine possession and now obstructing the path of justice, which shows our commitment to bring the perpetrators to court.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is far from access to the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Dita gave a question and answer session about herself in which she said that her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a death row client in the US, Muhammad Ali being his dinner guest and inequality being an inspiration for their work.
Kenya press furious over controversial media law
"The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional and said," "This is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is it to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary in the coming days?" ""
"" "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it," "said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM."
He said that the new Media Tribunal will always be biased as it is part of the Government and that the ban on content and advertising will hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"" "I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to them to reject this Bill and send back MPs," "he said."
"According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will provide the government with" "strict control over the media," "while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been" "dealt a severe blow" "and termed the bill as cruel."
The Bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after the September attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of troops sent to the site of the attack, showing them deliberately looting the mall, which angered Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo had summoned two journalists and media persons for questioning, though the summons was withdrawn after the media created ruckus.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined 2 crore Kenyan shillings and 10 lakh Kenyan shillings for different journalists and there will be an additional risk of being removed from the list or not being given official press recognition.
In case of non-payment of fine, the Tribunal also has the power to confiscate the property of the violator.
"According to the Daily Nation," "only one semiconductor is sufficient to shake the foundation of most FM stations."
"It also said that these measures can have devastating effects that are described as Kenya's" "vibrant blogosphere." ""
By shutting down the media, politicians know that they can do their own thing.
"Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew Kenyi describes the media as a major source of control and balance in public life and writes," "No one will ever know."
"" "If left to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the age of hunting and gathering," "he wrote."
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced public anger.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejecting deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored about 532,000 shillings per month, tax-free hefty wages, which is considered to be the highest in the world.

They have demanded complete abolition of house tax from Panchkula.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said the city had got new councillors and mayors after the municipal elections, but they did not have the power to get work done.

But no steps are being taken to invest money in the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.

He said that the condition of health services and education system in the villages has deteriorated.

UN sets new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations is soon going to launch a new set of targets that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
"In order to replace the MDD ending in 2015, the Australian diplomat played an important role in furthering the" "Sustainable Development Goals" "just before the overnight Sustainable Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro."
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gillard during the Summit.
"UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that the time has come to" "rise above national interests." ""
"" "I am very happy that member countries have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process for setting universal sustainable development goals."
These SDGs will be based on our development agenda under the Millennium Development Goals, and will be an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will do everything possible to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to meet our far reaching objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of MDG.
The issue of Mozambican security concerns is growing into a confrontation by powerful personalities
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo, along with a statue of the founder of Mozambique, President Samora, who was staring down at him for a rare public demonstration to raise the slogan of peace.
"We want peace back, we want stability," "said Vanessa de Susa, CEO of an investment company."
Fearful of the future of her country, she unilaterally changed her corporate dress from a T-shirt we demand security and joined the crowd of the capital independence square on Thursday.
The conflict between the government forces and Ray Namo for two weeks has been reported almost every day, more than 20 years before a peace agreement.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement supported by the white ruling Rhodesia and the apartheid government of South Africa as part of initially efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a fully developed struggle, but recent events have discouraged foreign investors and local people.
Lands have been high for the rapidly growing economy, some of the companies that discovered large offshore gas reserves and coal reserves in the North East, including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vel, Eni, could bring in more than $50bn investments next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the major political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tension.
Ray Namo says the government started the latest struggle on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La province, a traditional Ray Namo fort
As the attacks on the former rebels and the rise again, the government forces attacked the Renmo bases and tried to kill the Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, Fernando Mazang, a spokesman for Ray Namo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Ray Namo for the trigger of the clash, accusing the soldiers of attacking.
President Armando Giden has called for reckless concerns about instability.
"Mr Jidane told AFP, French news agency on Wednesday that Mr Dhakama had seen himself as a" "loser" "and that his forces are trying to prove that he can implement his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mazhang was quoted as saying that the 1992 Peace Accord was annulled by Ray Namo but later again became a matter of concern.
He told FT that it is not being awarded the Samjhauta free limo
"Our vision is to come back for negotiations, but seriously," "Mr Mazhang said."
The previous talks between the two sides did not do much to reduce hundreds of tensions in a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about him," "said Yusuf Han, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambican expert."
There are no good interlocutors among them, nor are they necessary to create types of concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already spoken about boycotting municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
The share of Ray Namo in voting has been declining since 1992, while a new party, created by a former Ray Namo member, is expected to improve his performance in the Mozambican Democratic Movement, elections.
"" "Mr. Majhang says -" "" Those who are stepping down at the end of their second term next year - want to destroy the democracy of the country. "" "
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want to leave the presidency because he does not want peace, he does not want a transparent election," "Majhang said."
It is not clear what kind of capability Ray Namo has had, but he has made disruptive hit and run visits at police stations and vehicles on a major North South Highway.
Most of the clashes take place in La Province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, with host Beira Port, which relies on export of mining, coal, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
In June, Rio suspended its use for about a week after threatening to attack the Ray Namo line.
Ray Namo would be able to repeat this danger or not, when asked about it, was Mr. Mazhangwinit.
"" "Ray NaMo" "things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community," "Mr Mazhang said."
The government of instability further exacerbated the frustration, says Fernando Lima, Media Cope, who heads an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development, and recent floods of abductions.
"People are the government and the president of those responsible for the country's future, and they think they should be one to find solutions to problems," "he says."
The Omar Sultanate, a exhibitor, still needs stability.
No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to roads, he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends, as models for a way of writing life.
"Thor 's stories could show that" "all subtle tactics in cruel power have no competition," "while Arthurian legends showed the importance of having a dream."
"Even to teach many of the myths, it would not be" "unsuitable to be taught in wild and in some cases vulgar and school," "Cross Lee Holland advocated one of the appropriate acts of age."
"I find it surprising that in America, myths and folk songs are already a part of the field of education," "he said."
I am supporting it as a plan for 20 years.
"He has called writers and teachers" "more enlightened" "and this is a" "new turning point" "for children, as well as messages being presented in entertaining stories."
"Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Biowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folklore, said:" "You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
Perhaps for a child, there is a big difference between an adult writer writing and an adult writer writing for an adult, some meaning of hope is required.
Everything has to be simplified or a happy end, because it is a spontaneous feeling of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than told through a story.
The old base is not showing.
Head Constable Om Prakash retired after serving in the police department in Ghumarwin for 32 years.
Officers and employees of the Police Department organised a farewell party on the occasion.
Om Prakash is a resident of Bhaparal village in Bani Bhapral Gram Panchayat.
He served better during his tenure.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New York
People can argue that the city of New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in the United States: almost a hundred years ago, humorist Frank Fey, who worked as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to make jokes directly to the crowd in the manner of conversation.
Fey's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institute Caroline, Caroline celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theatres.
"" "Most of these headliners appeared in Carolines, and became a huge success, at a level where they became too big to play at the club," "says Hirsh."
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This years event includes the presence of Vanda Cyks, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, Stand up for Heroes which included other artists including Bruce Springsteen, John Stuart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this years festival have come from non-traditional means, such as shows on small networks such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Crowl rose to prominence from Deep Cable Citcom (FXX's cheaply Ronchi Fantasy - The League with the football theme), and is now his own comedy central sketch show.
"Jenny Slate has been a cast member of" "Saturday Night Live" "and" "Parks and Recreation," "although she is best known for her Vital video series" "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On." ""
Other young comedians with different sounds, including crawls and slates (Anthony Jesselnik with a completely different voice, satirical, ethnically centered W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg's talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a stand-up comedian, but has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
"From 2005 to 2007, she hosted a show on TV called" "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg." ""
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall, in the heart of Manhattan.
"" "The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry's works."
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he goes into the street between two buildings and used to think in himself that if I ever lose my entire money, I will stay here.
Oil prices continue to fall to $96 per barrel
As oil prices continue to decline, as on Friday, a report of concern over higher supplies is offset, where the power hungry manufacturing sector in China is strengthening.
Benchmark for December delivery in electronic trading on the US raw New York Mercantile Exchange was down 14 cents at $96.24 per barrel in Europe until late morning.
The contract fell 5.8 per cent for the month of October, 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US supplies grew by 4.1 million barrels last week
Over five weeks, supplies have grown by more than 2.5 million barrels.
But a strong demand suggestion has shown that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come on Friday due to increase in activity.
This shows that growth can continue to strengthen Chinas economic recovery after being less confined to the previous quarter of 7.8 per cent in the third quarter in a couple of decades.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude oil used by US refineries.
The court has blocked action on the New York Police Department's pause and sports policy
On Thursday, a federal appeal court blocked changes that required a judge's order for the New York Police Department's break and play program and removed the judge from the case.
Judge Shira Shindeler of the US Circuit Court of Appeals 2 & said the decision would be delayed as a result of an appeal by the city.
In Judge Nagar, it had ruled in August in violation of the Constitution in the manner in which it had prevented and excluded people from its schedule of questioning.
The city police department has also decided to allocate a monitoring to help change its policy and associated training programmes, its findings and its remedial orders.
The appellate court heard the arguments on the migration of the request on Tuesday.
The appellate court has said that since it compromised the need for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a series of media interviews and committed wrongdoings by the public other than the code of conduct for US judges, the judge's case should be removed, statements should be publicly answered to criticize the court.
The judge ruled that the police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its stoppage and sports programme.
It has appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and it is most closed where some have ordered a pilot program to test body wearing cameras in the campus.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police stay.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
Punctuation and sports devices have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and sports policy has been in some form for decades, but has been recorded mostly from black and Hispanic men, preventing dramatic growth under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg from 684330 to a time high in 2011.
One suit was filed in 2004 by four men and all minorities and became a class action case.
Supporters of the NYPD break and change in sports programme have said that unfair behaviour will end up with another more credible and effective police force and other police departments can influence the use of policies.
Opponents say the changes will dampen the morale of the police, but crime, wastage of money and not under pressure from thousands of officers over the past decade will solve a widespread problem of a police force under pressure.
The judge noted that there was no end for breaks and sports, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the stop of NYPD.
Participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training in large numbers.
Over a period of seven days, all the participants were informed about several disciplines including tent pitching, flag pole etc.
The responsibility of training is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
Participating in Sarva Dharma Prarthana, all the participants are spreading the spirit of unity.
Camp Head Vipin Kumar is providing his special support to the State Training Commissioner.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
"Andy Colson, former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using" "phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face" "in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clark's love affair while he was his home secretary."
"Prosecutor Andrew Aedes QC told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clark was associating with his" "attractive special adviser," "Hannah Palby."
"The court said the newspaper appointed private investigator Glenn Mulkare to hack Polby's voicemail and keep an" "watch," "but Colson also called and gave up his voicemail."
"Mr Aedes said," "The prosecution suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside people's homes and keep articles in front of people, see how people react to it." ""
He said that NOTW used three ways to investigate cases: phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face.
The third one was attended by the editors themselves.
Apparently, he knew another way, that is, about Nigerni.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
"He says," "No, we say," "Yes, he knew exactly." ""
"The rumor about Clark's romantic relationships was first introduced by the AOTW feature desk when a sexually interested source in Ms. Polby said:" "Do not waste your time, he is with Charles."
From home in Mulcare in August 2006, a tape of voice mail was seized at least three times from Ms. Polby's phone.
"The investigators also found entries in the personal investigator's computer on which Ms. Palby and her sister were named" "Project." ""
During the period during which she was being examined, an anonymous phone call was made to Ms. Palbis grandparents seeking information about her.
Former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlebeck and former Reporter James Weatherup witnessed the visit of Ms. Polby.
"On 18 June 2005, Colson told him through a voicemail:" "I have found a story that we are planning to run tomorrow, which I would certainly like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Aedes said that Colson's involvement in this case is in Paton, with other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had spoken to Mr. Blancet about his romantic relations with a married woman when he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Colson and Brooks refused to compromise with others to hack the phone between October 3, 200. and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlebek and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.
NSA disclosures on state monitoring promote corporate fear.
Late in August on a quiet day, a German police helicopter stormed the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany.
On the directions of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of a US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundeswank.
The German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of Listening antenna and indicated an exchange action between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
"James Clapper, Director of US National Intelligence, stressed that the US should no longer use its foreign intelligence capabilities in September to" "steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase the line below them." ""
But ever since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has become a whistleblower, began to tell American surveillance the treasure of his secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director does not keep his promise.
The US National Security Agency spy on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, expressed fears about state surveillance, it said.
The last thing came to light when it was found that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was hacked, possibly a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, business leaders are certainly also making possible targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it will be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," "says Oliver Gran, president of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies."
According to a survey published by German companies consultancy in July, the US is now almost a major risk like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
Leak by Mr. Snowden in all documentation, however, there is no evidence that the United States has known the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of EU's internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are doubting this.
Someone in the German parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"" "This is not the way," "said Haso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP."
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he would not have been allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything is concessional in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about US technical refining and espionage access have proved to be a blow to some companies that previously believed that China is the biggest surveillance threat
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing umbrella where European authorities are more aware that the data stored in the US is under that jurisdiction and therefore has become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business entity, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled their plans to use an American-based cloud provider after disclosing about the data prism mining program.
"Jim Snake, co-CEO of SAP, says:" "We saw a new question that did not come to customers a year ago - is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports were merely confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore should be guarded at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
This has always happened.
"This has been a subject for many years, and through original current discussion, nothing has changed," "says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we do the same, as it is in national interest to defend our business
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in defence systems and are an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, messages have been recorded for a long time, whether it is naive to leave a business from home with usb sticks, or leaving a laptop without shelter in a hotel room to say at least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of car manufacturer Audi, says, This is a year old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings as they cannot be used as remote hearing devices
German BFV executives advise to consider using simple prepaid mobile while smart phones are compromising on foreign visits at risk.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown away.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are at the top of the global market.
"Small and medium sized companies often lack experience, effectively protecting corporate secrets against unauthorized access to personnel and financial resources," "BfV warns in a report."
The US has warned other countries about economic spying for its own companies.
According to the France The Washington Post, in February the name of US national intelligence was named in another tier of criminals involved in hacking for economic intelligence behind Russia and Israel.
"According to a board member of a German blue chip company," "French are the worst when it comes to economic espionage"
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: The services well know that all countries, even if they cooperate in non-terrorist warfare, spy on their allies.
No one became a fool.
The parents of a Georgian teenager who was killed in a unique accident believe that his son was killed
A Georgian teenager whose body was found wrapped in a restling mat in his high school gym believes his son was murdered, his family lawyer said on Thursday.
On January 11, Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA, was found trapped in a mat standing directly behind the blitchers inside his high school gym.
Investigators from the Landes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in a unique accident, but the family of the 17-year-old boy denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Kramp, appearing for Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that he fully believes that his son has been killed.
They have no faith in the manner in which the Sheriff was told death.
"" "They believe that this is beyond the logic of physical law and general wisdom," "Kramp said."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"" "He had sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag"
US Advocate General Michael Mulray on Thursday said he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, given that many important questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered for some crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
"" "I am of the view that there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation."
"Moore told the reporter that early autopsy indicated that Johnson's death was a result of" "static suffocation." ""
According to Moore, however, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death.
"" "There are many questions which need to be answered or verified."
Murray also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of the Landes County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia judge ordered officials to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boys parents say they hope that video footage will give some indication of how he died.
CDC issues Allergic Guidelines for Children in Schools
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies of children in schools.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the US government as the number of school going children is increasing due to food allergies.
Now one in every 20 children in the US has food allergies.
The CDC observed that between 1997 and 2007, there has been an increase of 18% in cases of food allergies in children.
The guidelines provide information to schools on how to inform teachers and staff about food allergies of children, and how to handle any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been advised to keep stock of epinephrine which is the brand's auto-injector most commonly used to combat potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
The State Legislative Assembly has recently updated the rules so that schools can easily store large quantities of epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children with allergic reactions.
"Children may say," "It seems something is chewing in my tongue," "it seems that my tongue has a hair," "or" "my tongue is hanging." ""
Parents of intersex kids can choose the gender of their children
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize a third gender for children born with vague genitals.
Now newborn children will no longer be traditionally referred to male or female.
As per the new law, parents are not required to declare sex to such children, which allows them to declare sex as' unscheduled 'or' unspecified 'on the birth certificate of the child.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make hasty decisions regarding gender-specification surgery for newborns, and combat discrimination against intersex children.
"According to BBC, an intersex person had said years later," "I am neither male nor female."
I will continue to be an injured, stained pedestrian made by doctors.
It is estimated that every year one in 2,000 children is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the investigation of sexual development disorders, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or testicles), or unusually developed sex.
Valis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify the gender when there is no sex determination and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before conducting surgery, if such a situation arises.
"Dr. Jack Dresher, a New York City psychologist who specialises in gender identification, said that Germany's new law" "seems to be a good thing." ""
Intersex creates moral confusion in children.
"" "Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but this does not happen to most children."
You can specify the sex without surgery, and then see how the identification develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
The report filed before the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not related to gender but to its biological composition, which is neither clearly male nor female but either joint or is not clearly defined.
These features can demonstrate to themselves secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or chromosomal structure, and hormones.
The report provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of employment, as well as the offences of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-corresponding sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult persons to mark male, female or third gender on their official documents.
"In June, 52-year-old Australian Norry May-Welby became the world's first recognized" "gender-less" "man after winning a legal appeal for a lifetime" "unspecified" "gender status."
According to the Interior Ministry, the German passport will also have a third specification as X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, gender issues in neighbouring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strict Catholic country have signed a petition for withdrawal of gender theory from school books.
"US website Catholic Online has also opposed Germany's law, saying," "While the world is going to be in a situation where gender itself is a choice, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction." ""
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn also told Baby Zone that she would like to see children being specified sex at birth.
"" "Raising without additional limits is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, named after the beautiful Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the gender as slate that could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that gender identification is a complex task, and sometimes even doctors may make mistakes, who do not know what children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
"Dresher says," "In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a" "psychiatric emergency." ""
When these children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The current theory of treatment of children with vague genitals was presented by Dr. John Mani of the University of John Hopkins, who considered the gender to be cultuitive.
"He coined the term" "gender identity" "and argued how social and environmental signs-parents raise a child by interacting with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether she should be identified as a man or as a woman."
But in a case of 1966, known as John / Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis had accidentally sex during the circus to get the child out of the ovary and raise it like a girl.
"" "Mani presented the case as a successful case of transfer, but that did not happen," "Dresher said."
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
"Dresher said that some doctors are still" "following the same pattern." ""
But with the advent of the Internet in the years since 1990, these sex surgeries began to appear and not happy with the results.
Similar was the case with Montana's 36-year-old author Jim Bruce, who was born with the XY male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
"Doctors did not clearly understand that his sex was small, or that his saffron was large, but they were certain that he could never live a" "satisfied life" "as a man."
Therefore, shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and ovaries were removed and raised like a girl by surgery.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"" "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, she was going to undergo vaginoplasty.
But depressed and feeling some disturbance, he demanded medical records.
This made him realise the terrible truth.
I was bound at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man back, fed testosterone and removed his breast.
He became barren due to surgery.
Today, he convinces people to normalise their perception of intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project.
"However, Anne Tamer-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Information Choice, expresses concern that German law" "invites chips and stigma." ""
"She says," "Many activists feel that German law will motivate parents to take quick decisions and specify an" "unscheduled" "child."
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We think that instead of waiting, specifying male or female gender is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only speculate.
"Tamar-Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because" "it allows adults to be identified in third gender." ""
"" "Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal gender."
German law deals with specifying it at birth.
This is not a battle fought by newborns at this time.
As they grow older, they can make their own decisions related to their body.
"But Dr. Erleen Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist whose daughter has sexual development disorders, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that German law would" "empower both parents and children." ""
Baratzi's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called the complete androgen insensitivity feature.
Since her androgen receptor had defect, female characteristics developed in Katie.
He has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries in his body.
Katie, 29, is now married and a resident of the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she expects to adopt or become a mother through gestational surrogacy.
"" "This law allows parents not to take any hasty decisions on their own."
It gives them proper understanding and time by some testing before writing 'male' or 'female'.
In this way, you stay healthy - raise your child, love your child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy it.
We do not need to undergo surgery in a hurry that cannot be returned.
"" "It brings children into the decision making process and frees parents from the anxiety that motivates them as they do not believe they are doing well," "he said."
Finally, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable with -- and that will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal awareness camp was organised by Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar under the chairmanship of Chairman of the Committee and Sub Judge, Ramnagar, Sandeep Kaur at Middle School, Dalher, Ramnagar.
It informed the students and others about the right to education and the law for the economically backward.

A large number of villagers were present on the occasion.
Consider the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisors to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton as the Vice President of the United States for ticket 2012.
"The most notable explosion at the revelation is the heavily anticipated 2012 campaign Tom," "Double Down: Game Change 2012" "by Mark Halperin and John Helen."
"The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the top advisors to the President held" "comprehensive group-sessions and late 2011 polling" "to know if dumping Biden could help Obama's falling hopes of re-election."
According to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book gives full details of the efforts of the chief officials in the campaign and the introduction of the White House, the head of the former White House staff, to find out how the change from the former state secretary to the vice president affects the poll.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
It was known that only half a dozen of the Presidents close advisors, including former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Palouffe, were under consideration.
"" "Double Down" "claims that Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal coordination when his information was finally telling him that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation."
In an interview with Martin, Dell has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I said, keeping the whole scene in mind, and one of them, it was," "Daley told the newspaper."
"You remember, when the presidency was in danger at that time, we were in such a situation that" "Holy Christ, what else will we do?" ""
"While Dale described the research as" "cautious," "Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again made significant investments to find out how much dividend this claim would pay on poll."
"Campaigns do not spend as much as money on voting and focused groups as they are seriously considering something," "Martin said on AC360."
It is unclear, though, did Obama know that his team was looking for change?
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about the possible reshuffle.
"While Dale said he" "didn't think the President knew about the possible change," "the former Chief of Staff acknowledged that it was" "possible" "that Obama knew."
"Double Down" "will definitely not answer whether a political check has reached Obama's desk?"
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was not aware of Biden dumping ticket research.
"Probably," "Martin said."
Love glo-in-de-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glo-in-di-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the marine animal to develop the best breakfast.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and assured Chinese scientists used chemical brightness to rejuvenate the protein.
Ice cream will increase the pH level of the protein by reacting with the edible tongue and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says ice cream ignites with the heat of the mouth, that is, the more you want to win, the more it will ignite.
"" "This is an incredible thing, but early production will come from me 200 to about 2 grams of ice cream," "said Charlie, the founder of Lik Mi IM Delicius Ice Cream."
The protein that we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth heats up, the protein increases the pH level and the ice cream shines.
We have been testing for the last few months and it looks absolutely correct to share on Halloween as it has an amazing luminous effect
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I have made because the glitter of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold
So the cost of each scoop I get around 140 pounds.
However, the taste is very good.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol, apne, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaves, is famous for its unusual taste.
But his next work is going to be even more ambitious.
"He said:" "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is naturally impossible due to ice crystals that make refraction above ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the use of a latent quality of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire market in Rani Bagh market was packed with customers.
Recently, people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
Similar was the case with Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Central Market in Prashant Vihar.
Similar scenes were witnessed at bullion shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
People were also buying gold and silver jewellery and coins.
Due to this, other markets including the outer ring road were also blocked.
However, people coming out of the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, keep quiet late, and play for the dressing up neighborhood.
Nowadays, I have become more than a greedy person
I have not even signed in to get Kandy out of my apartment for the last two years and perhaps not this year.
But statistics show that I am a black sheep when Halloween arrives
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating Halloween this time, spending $6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing I have always seen in is the tendencies of every... Halloween.
According to the NRF, out of the total expenditure of $6.9 billion, the cost of the dress is estimated to be $1.2 billion
This year sexy inanimate things make everyone angry.
Women do not have to practice prostitution because they are also sexy food such as pizza, hamburgers and carrot
I hope for men that a lot of zombies, and thanks to the dead, Murdo's movement will create our Instagram feeds for space men this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes will be Zombies, Batman, Robbers and Churches.
I assume that there is nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dogs and surprisingly we were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will actually spend $330 million for pet clothing.
This is the irony that a lot of hotdogs are with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we do not see around.
According to Nielsen Company, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
The hairy bars, lollipop, milk dads, twizlers and Clark bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the US Department of Commerce, it is good news that 41 million metric and trix are going to participate in our neighbourhood.
But in reality, we will, and what we 're joking, buy during the 90 million pound chocolate helovin.
According to the confectioners association, we will not use one thing during the Halloween, but they will also sell about 35 million pounds.
That is about 9 billion individual bundles of maize.
This is a mystery. To solve so far
Nothing more than the philosophical Halloween ghosts.
"They are the best name," "terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison)," "cheek-o-cheek" "and were like" "House of Shock." ""
According to American power, in fact, there are 1200 officially approved ghosts in the United States that produce 500 million royalties, and the terrible good pictures that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and comments you at Nice Face.
Finally, let's talk about kaddu.
Charlie Brown introduced the great kaddu when we were children, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is something that we have done since we were small.
Fortunately, for us, the Baby in a Pumpkin trend started last year due to Pinterest, so most of us grew up by carving these guards and not selling them.
According to the US Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend around $106 million on kaddu.
Jack O - The slowly fading lantern on its front porch may have grown from Illinois, an increase of 542 million pounds this year.
If you are looking for additional loans, in phone Tim and Susan Matildon Napa, Caliph., and above, try carving their 2,032 pounds of kaddu.

The dream of firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market in the transport area was not fulfilled.
The firecracker traders are stuck in the middle following a High Court order.
They cannot now do business in the temporary firecracker market set up at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licences for business in the transport area.
The Commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue as unsafe.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs 10 lakh for not making proper arrangements there.
In its order, the High Court has rapped the Amritsar administration for what it could not solve even a single problem of firecracker traders for nine years.
They could not be provided proper space in the city.
Thereafter, due security arrangements were made and the firecracker traders were asked to issue licences for their business in the market at Jahajgarh.
Even though the firecracker traders were happy with the order, their happiness was overshadowed by the police on Friday.
A team of the Aslaha Licence Branch of the police reached the Patakha market and counter it and sell the farm.
Thereafter, it was impossible to fulfil the conditions mentioned to them in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, in-charge of Asalha Licence Branch Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached Patakha Market.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
Therefore, licences were not issued to firecracker traders.
Diwali is just a day away.
Due to this, traders are incurring heavy losses.
They are losing crores of rupees.
firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say they will stake claim to the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Angry firecracker traders took out a protest march from Jahajgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the district administration and the police.
Following this, the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue was also closed.
In a mine, a fire brigade was called to rescue a lost poppy after facing a critical mountain 50 feet above the ground
Cocker Spanil Ruby ran away after a small road collision
He was seen three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine
Fire brigade personnel pulled down the front portion of the rock from the rope to save the dog from the dead mouth
After Papi somehow got stuck in the face of a critical mountain 50 feet above the ground, he got a fortunate life by calling the firefighters.
Nine - month - old Cocker Spanil Ruby fled after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
Her owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and her girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, were in the flat mine in West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and has thanked the Western Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After fleeing after a small accident, he had discovered his lost dog like a lunatic, and posted an appeal on social networking sites.
At 2.15 pm on Wednesday, a fast-sighted dock walker saw Ruby on a mountain in a mine at an altitude of 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Clackheaton Fire Station reached the spot and pulled Ruby down with a rope to save him and used a stomach tube to bring him down the rock.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: She was in a critical condition.
She was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
She did not act even a single act during the rescue, it was a stone.
But now it is good.
She was then eating a biscuit.
It was a call for absolutely unusual help.
Rather, it is unbelievable to see the dog.
"Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said:" "Ruby is lucky to survive."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in even worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
"Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said:" "It was terrible to see the rescue operation"
At first, I could not believe how she reached there.
It is amazing to have him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was very tired and fell, she would certainly have fallen down.
The fire brigade did a great job.
What they have done is really a very courageous job.
We are grateful to him, and they were all great.
"From Kigali, Mr. Alderson also said:" "We feared she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire brigade did a great job.
I cant believe how she reached there.

George Caravan: Euro dissolution gave Scott an option
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that as a condition for EU membership, independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel zone across Europe.
Passport control over the Barwick and the range of barbed wire on the walls of Hadrian indicate stories.
It is true that the Strathclyde Paper described the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it was not predictably described in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as per their requirement.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen region, there will be cheaper discounts for Brussels for sustained non-compliance in return for receiving what Brussels actually wants from Scotland.
So, then, a story.
First of all, I heard the baseless news about passport control about 40 years ago.
Yet, an interesting point was lost in reciting this interesting old story again.
Anyway, why should independent Scotland be expected to bid for Europe?
Why London's Yoga should be purchased and sold to Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: The great plan to organize Europe, the post-war plan has finally come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe has officially died.
Parties dedicated to opposing the EU throughout the EU or closing the euro as a common currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptil Alternative for Germany - which has been founded this year - suddenly received nearly five million votes in the federal election of September, and thus effectively eliminated the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dams) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be a game changer.
Along with the stringent rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the constraints imposed on the national economies by complying with the same currency have forced many to think that project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not play much of a role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments it was true only in Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the exchange rate in favour of German exporters something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a state of inherent loss of productivity as compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salary and public expenditure which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Deep European productivity sickness goes beyond the current budget and currency problems.
"" "As a result of the" "" "green" "" "" energy policies imposed by Brussels to exempt French and German energy firms on consumer spending, European industries pay twice as much for electricity as the United Nations and four times for gas. "" "
This is the crippling cost loss that we have already seen in the Grangemouth.
Even the freeze of all wages in the world cannot save the European petrochemicals industry from being affected by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, there is a sense of revolt among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, top French politicians saw the EU as a measure to control Germany, and to provide Paris with billing at par with Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing the French economy to collapse.
As a result: Marin Lee Penn's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has won the recent by-election, pushing the ruling Socialist to third place.
At present, the Front is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - it is a timely warning to the British Labour that they cannot assume that the dissolution for the left will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Lee Penn doing with his new fame among the French white, working class?
The party wants to use next year's EU elections to form an anti-EU, anti-currency group in the European Parliament.
If, as far as possible, the EU opposition performs well in these elections, such a group can influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My vision is: Soon, the combination of anti-EU and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will end the euro.
"The euro will not be complete, but it will return to the" "(sovereign) nations of Europe" "in some form, supported by General de Gaulle."
Germany and some of its subsidiaries may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I hope that UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing its proximity to the US.
However, Washingtons growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland next?
We can choose to remain the area (essentially) of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a loose European system, provided we have our own currency.
It will be easier for non-federal nations to work with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our economic independence while walking on the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland has been the most successful anti-austerity political campaign in Europe, winning an amazing majority in 2011 based on the Tori-Lib Dam coalition, opposing (and implemented) deductions proposed by Labour Chancellor Alastair Darling.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as it would have to accept the rules of economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels in that case.
Early Childhood: Early Childhood
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls are younger than white girls of their age.
Physical transformation does not mean that youth is near
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be one of the causes of puberty at a young age
Premature puberty is not so effective in boys
Pat Ethiris, a former CNN correspondent, is an expert journalist on child health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breast and genitals at the age of 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz clarified that these early physical changes are common among American girls, showing a new trend.
"" "I spend a lot of time assuring parents that it generally does not show rapid progress towards full youth," "says Caplovitz."
Direct symptoms of development such as sprouting of the breasts, genitals and hair of the eye, and physical odour are visible in girls ahead of time.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (First Menstrual).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breast begins to develop, first menstruation takes at least two to three years," "says Caplovitz, who is also the author of" "premature puberty in girls: the guide needed to deal with this common problem." ""
The most accurate testing time for the development of youth.
"There is a debate as to what is the beginning of puberty, but when breast development increases before the age of 8, two call it" "child-adults." ""
In most cases, the process will slow or stop - which the pediatrician can closely inspect.
In case of more rapid progress, an investigation by an endocrinologist may be required to address the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatment for delay in premature menstruation and other consequences: premature ageing of bones can lead to underdeveloped growth and stunting as adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age, growth rate, and emotional maturity of the child.
Psychological aspects are also important.
"Caplovitz is aware of drugs but admits," "suppressing youth can increase behavioural issues, and girls may start feeling different from their peers." ""
Another major problem can be understood: Parents simply do not want their young daughter to have menstruation.
"" "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene," "Caplovitz said."
"A woman whose daughter started menstruation at the age of 10 recalls," "It was a shock." ""
Although this was a symptom and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and returned worried that among her friends she had first started menstruation.
There are many popular theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence to accuse hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexually oriented messages in the media.
Boys are also getting the same age as girls.
Caplovitz determines the rule that the main cause is the outbreak of obesity.
She had helped conduct studies on girls aged 6 to 9 years in 2001, which connects body fat with puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to be young before white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, models of premature youth, from economic conditions to weather and genes, appear to be influenced by everything.
Other puzzles: Although boys are achieving facial and genitals at a young age, the trend of complete puberty is not as clear as that of girls in them.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see the hair of the mouth and genitals.
"" "We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginning of youth," "says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician endocrinologist at the Groeb Children's Hospital in Maristown, New Jersey."
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatricians to seek their opinion on how to talk to their children.
"" "This may mean talking ahead of the expected time," "advised Caplovitz."
If you remain calm, your child will normally answer properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.

According to the Meteorological Department, the cold will increase further in the coming days.
Large orders of Jet manufacturers at stake over seat width controversy
There is a race between the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist class seats for long distance flights
The controversy focuses on the width of the economy class seat in long-haul aircraft, not always as given by airlines, but whose allotted space efficiency is claimed to be the key by the latest Jet Airways SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus is expected to offer at least 18 inches (46 cm) of wide seat in the economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by the airlines, said its chief rival Boeing.
The controversy comes at a time when after the 17-21 incident, there was a competition to sell the larger version of the twin engine of the long-range aircraft out of a possible recorded order.
How the previous division of the aircraft has been created - especially whether the seating is equal to 9 or 10 is being designed keeping in view the high capacity claims?
"Boeing says the" "777 X" "will have 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the economic department."
Airbus says competing with the A350 will take 350 people to a seat that is equal to 9 inches, leaving them 18 inches behind.
Aircraft giants often strike trade on technical matters through advertisements in the business press.
Now, Airbus 777 X is expected to dominate the Dubai ArShow at more than 100 orders, further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that whatever the beginning of the war of witchcraft has been, will you accept it at the same time at a restaurant?
"Airbus sales chief John Lehi said" "Boeing is also offering long distance flights to hybrid seats from regional turbo." ""
In the form of change, people may be getting bigger, but the way the aircraft is sitting has not changed.
According to the U.S. Health Department data, between the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo ne defined the modern long-time Ki Yatra ko, and the centuries-old Ant Me average 40-49 year old American male ke weight me increased by 10 percent.
According to US health statistics, the average American male waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its opponent is clinging to a seat concept in 1950 when the average circumference of the new name Jet Set was narrow.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional 53 per cent sleep quality in seat width.
Boeing has disputed Airbus seat measurement data, and said it does not depend on the manufacturers decision on how airlines balance fares and facilities.
Research also shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of more than one cabin
"" "It actually tells airlines how to provide flexibility and what they need to do to succeed," "said Kent Kraver, a Boeing cabin expert."
"They don't want to tell us who they are benefiting from." ""
They know their business better than anyone else.
For Flyers it is about the elbow room, but for suppliers it is fast an issue that can affect income.
The trade behind the dispute is estimated to be at least $700 billion. Competition for aircraft orders is enough in the coming decades to measure US and European exports.
Reuters reported that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout was actually a fight issue between new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that their new twin engine design has 20 per cent performance per seat compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Air.
The claim of Boeing's performance depends on the comparison of the 10 777 x one original 777 design.
10 equal to the profit in unit cost has now been used as comparison.
"Kevin Kenniston, head of Airbus Passenger Facility in Europe, says," "This Boeing plane is doing to make our products more competitive and capture more seats." ""
Analysts, on the other hand, say the entire 10-seater per row cabin is suggested for the current 777 S that many passengers are in favour of the Denzer layout, which can also go at cheaper rates.
"" "Eighteen inches of seat width will be very good for passengers, but the reality is that Airbus's trade point proposal is driven by the threat of 777," "said Mary Karby, founder and editor's Runway Girl Network"
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
Jet sellers across the world should also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
While taking more rest, all builders are also providing low cost air services of Jet aircraft and high density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but they say it is not sold yet.
But recently, as long as Airbus insisted on comprehensive cabin seats on some of its jet planes to require more cabin facility.
Modern jet aircraft are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it can deviate from the wave of sales of 777 X.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can end smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The only dose of the vaccine was capable of keeping rats safe from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further testing is required before human trials begin, which may take many years, but early signs are positive, said Ronald Crystal, Professor at Wheel Cornell Medical College in New York.
"" "We are very hopeful that the strategy of such a vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available in the market in today's time, but they found that their nicotine addiction is far more powerful than these existing methods."
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been designed to deliver genetic information with the objective of creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies search for any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevent the absorption of nicotine inside the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the mice vaccinated later given nicotine continued their normal activity.
"But the rat who was not vaccinated" "liked," "says the researcher, was an indication that nicotine had reached his brain."
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be administered at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high as the liver will make the cell an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before they are tempted to try cigarettes to protect them from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to quit.
"" "They will find out that if they resume smoking, they will not get any pleasure from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit," "he said."
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the postmortem, the exact cause of the death of the tigress could not be ascertained.
In a befitting reply, the Forest Department has prima facie termed the death of the tigress as natural.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of Ramnagar forest division found the body of a tiger near the Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi drain.
All the organs of the body of the tigress were safe and there were no injury or injury marks on it.
The postmortem of the tigress was conducted on Friday by Vivek Pandey, Conservator of Forests, Saket Badola, Deputy Director of CTR, Haksha Nasim, DFO, Bharat, a veterinary doctor of CTR and Hema Rathore, a veterinarian of Kotabag.
According to sources, the internal bodies of the tigress were found to be damaged during the postmortem.
The exact cause of the tiger's death could not be ascertained.
Departmental officials continued to give a befitting reply to the killing of the tigress.
However, the internal organs of the tiger have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for topsycological examination to confirm the poison.
The death of the tiger can be said to be natural, said Vivek Pandey, a forest conservator.
No injury marks were found on the body.
However, the area is being searched for this and Bisra is being sent for confirmation.
Tripodi deny that we are being influenced by obide.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Corpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to refute the maritime lease policy at the request of his political guru, Eddie Obaid, the patron of former New South Wales, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
The independent commission against corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obaid had filed a case with several state ministers for violation of lease policy circulars where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obide, without tender, were renewed after its expiry in August 2005.
Lin Ashpole, who knew the hidden interests of Mr. Obide after evidence provided by the former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the Government had pressurized the introduction of public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, circular enterprises for leases, from which Obide earned $250 million annually, were renewed from unleased tenders.
Shri Tripathi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change at the request of Mr. Obide, Shri Tripodi had urged for a change in the government lease policy
A copy of a phone call presented at the ICAC in August and September 2007, Mr. Obide and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Fisheries Department of Mr. Obide after working in the Ministry of Ports
"Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheeley asked Mr Trypodi," "Was the development of the commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No," "replied Mr. Tripodi."
I cannot remember what was discussed, but it was certainly not.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obide.
According to officials, Israeli fighter jets stormed Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed Fox News.
The official did not specify the purpose, but there was at least one purpose.
The Associated Press reports that the target Russian missiles were SA-125.
Israel has carried out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas may undergo authentication test
"" "A" "" "authentic" "" "test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the Government as it aims to expand a stringent action." ""
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a criteria designed to prevent 457 being used to fill up unskilled posts in Australia or to transport family and friends in a covert manner.
Condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, former Labour MP Maxine McQ today said it could provoke Australia's neighbours.
"He told the India Institute in the US today that" "foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" "and" "strong statements about Australian people before jobs" "are a very unpleasant repetition at a time when the unions have demanded a safe labour market."
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been protected and I would not be surprised if some people in the region had seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures which were earlier considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendon O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about the traffickers, has implemented five proposed changes, while the rest are under consideration.
"If the" "validity" "criteria are adopted, the visa applicant can be examined whether the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee is the owner of the visa sponsor or the relevant person or the personal partner."
Professionals may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, as earlier businessmen who wanted to sponsor fewer employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of cardiac arrest after coming into a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man was accompanied by his nine-year-old son, who had come to Australia on a trip, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, one of his adult cousin, who was on the same ship, has been covered.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project in Scotland.
The work by HS2 indicates high speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
"Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would" "unite the UK." ""
"Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was" "very excited" "to work with the UK government on the project."
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
On completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high speed link between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which was in talks with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Limited to consider further improving rail capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours.
"According to Baroness Kramer:" "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer."
We are moving ahead with HS2, as its benefits will be very high.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity to 18 UK cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be further connected due to HS2.
"According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael:" "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
"For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael to make a" "clear" "return of Scotland to the HS2 network."
Mr Brown said: High speed rail is expected to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland throughout the UK in terms of high speed rail.
We are, therefore, excited to work in partnership with the British Government to explore options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefits for all and meeting the Glasgo-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the Ministers of the British Government next year and taking a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electrical Equipment Rules to remain in force in Australia
In the wake of the easing of equipment regulations in the US, Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
"The US Federal Aviation Administration has left options open to US airlines to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment during important stages of flight, provided they remain in" "aircraft" "mode."
Passengers can still do this on many flights, but many people do not like being able to reach their e-books etc while flying and landing.
Australian airlines are considering this decision, according to which US airlines will have to do much more to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have any immediate plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment at critical stages of flight are still effective in Australia.
"At present, CASA does not have any specific regulation controlling the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," "the authority said, adding," "This issue comes under regulations, according to which airlines have to ensure that the security arrangements are always fully maintained, and passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members." ""
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA to expand the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but asked to take further action on the regulatory directive.
"" "We will welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we actually feel that it will provide a better experience to the customers as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our aircraft," "the spokesperson said."
Quantas said it would follow the current rules at the moment.
"" "As per our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used while flying and landing, and we do not have any immediate plan to change it," "it said."
FAA decisions apply to US alarms.
However, we have always been interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the decision of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary on each US airline and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio defaults with mobile devices, as well as amend their manual books, training material, carry on baggage program and brief details to passengers.
"" "After verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, it will allow passengers to use hand-held, lightweight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all heights," "the FAA said."
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to discontinue their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment be kept safely under the seat or in the upper coaches while taking off and landing.
Panbrokers silver due to difficulties faced by middle class in Singapore
Janani Ameerthalinga is taking cash with her gold bangles, rings and earrings to pay her daughter's school fees at a Ponshop at the Bendemir Shopping Centre in Singapore.
"" "My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it."
She says that although she earns $3,000 (US $2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia where domestic debt is increasing the valuex, where they are transacting, became the third ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Ownership of jewellery is not the only way to get cash - $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirathalinga - but almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Generally, panbrokers in Singapore charge an interest rate of 17 per cent per annum, slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch at the same shopping centre.
However, Panbrokers have the benefit of not requiring credit scrutiny or proof of salary, and can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are turning to ponshops due to rising household expenses and difficulties due to increase in domestic and consumer credit.
After strong growth for five years after the global financial disaster, and cheap credit in the developed economies due to simple monetary policy, low and middle-income families are moving to Ponshop to meet their needs due to sluggish credit of their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standards & Poors, described the rising domestic profit mainly due to rising mortgages as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
Asia has the highest domestic debt in proportion to GDP in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, it said.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP as against 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged marginally from the technical slowdown this week.
On Thursday, data showed a steady export slowdown and decline in consumer demand.
"" "The decisive point is that with rising prices, people from the middle to the lower category [of income scale] will try to increase their income in every possible way," "said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB."
In the last two years, historically high prices in gold prices have inspired people to pledge personal property as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to capitalise on the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items pledged at City-State 200 Pon outlets are gold.
People are saying, Gold prices are looking good, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain, and take it back next month.
Thailands largest Ponshop operator, Eegemini, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is such an increase in the mortgage business that the operators of the outlet in Bendemir are planning to expand not only to Valumax and 15 others like it in Singapore, but also to Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also to expand outside Asia, says Ya Lee Ching, executive director of Valumax.
The company will fund 60% of the Singapore dollars received in listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms. Ya says that mortgage not only provides cheaper rates than other lenders but also does not directly increase credit.
Customers pledge goods that they already have, and capitalisation of personal assets does not increase domestic debt.
Social acceptability of ponbroking is increasing to receive short-term and secure financial assistance.
It is not that panbrokers are used only by financially weak people.
In Singapore, even rich people use valuex outlets, mortgage gold bars or Rolex watches to get cash payments up to 60 per cent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
"" "These include wealthy individuals who need short-term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow requirements," "says Ms. Ya."
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
New Delhi | Jagran Business Desk: Mukesh Ambani's wife Nita Ambani is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.

$325 million rescue package for Taji's health
The Union Government has emphasized that strict conditions are also attached with the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's deteriorating health system which will ensure that the State Government does not waste funds.
"Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking" "immediate action" "to address the current crisis due to the ageing population of the island state, high rates of chronic diseases, and limitations of the system."
The decision to fund over a period of four years was taken in consultation with the Government with independent Tasmania MP Andrew Wilky.
The Government has brought in an emergency rescue package, which we are confident will address specific challenges being faced by the State, Ms.
The $325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan of $31 million.
2600 additional operations including orthopaedic and cataract surgeries will help in resolving past collected cases.
This also includes funds for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lonestation, post-hospitalization care, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"" "These investments are in line with the best practices I have been told by leading doctors to improve Tasmania's health system."
The Minister emphasized that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State has to maintain the current funding level to get Commonwealth funds, and report every month where the additional fund is being spent.
A three-member Commission will be constituted by the State to ensure effective and efficient service delivery by the State.
"Mr Wilky said, $325 million would not mean much unless there are real reforms to take Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level." ""
Yet, he praised the Government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he had first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.
"" "I hope that the federal support package will be very helpful in deleting the state public health system from the crisis-hit list," "Wilky said."
According to the State Government, these additional alternate processes will mainly revive the recent deductions.
"But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes todays announcement is a" "Band-Aid solution." ""
We are here because the Labour State Government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You cannot consider taking nearly half a billion dollars by the state government and giving 300 million dollars by the Commonwealth as a day of good news.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should be guaranteed that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation of Dennis Diderot's novel by Gillum Nikoloux details the best production design and duration, but it has become much more than what should have been done.
Reflecting the time of 1760 in France, the novel, Sujan, narrates the sad story of young Raees, whom his family members send to the convent.
When she mutinies, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the voluntarily oppressor Mother Superior, and becomes a erotic attraction for the other.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensation- and that is the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the narration, the audience is also at risk of becoming a boring film.
Dr Munna Singh, Vice Chancellor, CSA, has decided to levy entry fee in the garden due to the filth in the park.
A 15-day ultimatum has been given to the departments to rectify the situation.
The Vice Chancellor made a surprise inspection of the Deputy Director Seed and Area and Director Research along with the Horticulture Department at 10 am on Friday.
During this period, he found more than a dozen employees, including directors, missing from his seat in these departments.
After reprimanding him, he warned of salary cuts if he was found absent the next time.
Dr Naushad Khan, media in-charge of the university, said that a pass of Rs 30 will have to be made for a month long walk.
People will be able to walk in the garden every day at a fee of one rupee.
Work from the system: Files relating to various functions will reach the Vice Chancellor under one system.
Every employee shall not be entitled to enter the office of the Vice Chancellor with his / her file.
The concerned authorities will take the final to the Vice Chancellor.
The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing capability
On Thursday, the monitoring group said Syria has destroyed critical equipment to make chemical weapons and toxic gas combat materials, while a fierce conflict has emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are believed to be held.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement group said that nearly 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the Syrian Civil War, which began about three years ago.
The announcement of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Organisation came a day before the last date of 1st November
"The Hague-based organization had determined Damascus to" "destroy" "or" "ineffective" "the machinery used to mix chemicals in all chemical weapon production units and toxic gases and fill in combat materials."
The completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means that Syria can no longer build new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
Syria is currently believed to have 1000 MT of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent Sarin.
The UK based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement took place on Thursday when the conflict in the city of Safira increased, which experts believe is a chemical weapon production unit as well as a storage center.
The movement group, which details the death toll through the movement network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
This includes 61,067 civilians including 6,365 children, it said.
The government has said that 29,954 are members of the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are fighters fighting for the government and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that the dead included 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's military force fought rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
The war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, in a very short span of time, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
"The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team" "is still satisfied and confirmed and has seen all the important production and blending / filling equipment announced in Syria as destroyed." ""
"" "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit two centres due to security reasons.
"On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centres have been" "abandoned" "and the chemical weapons products kept there were transported to other announced centres, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira was one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
"In a comment issued by OPCW, Director General of the Monitoring Group Ahmet Uzumku said," "I salute the determination and courage shown by you in fulfilling the most challenging mission undertaken by this organization so far."
The three-year civil war has been a conflict between the Assad regime and its security forces, including members of the Alawite sect, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other incidents, the head of the observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a loud explosion at the Air Defence Centre in Latakia, Syria, on Wednesday.
He said the reason for the explosion has still not been identified.
The police have recovered fake registry, fake seals, laptops and photocopies of fake registry from the possession of the accused.
The police has registered a case against all the accused.
Those arrested have been identified as Rajeev Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Haibowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi, Commissioner of Police Paramjit Singh Gill said.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has fled from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with the clerk and record keeper of the registrar office, used to extract documents from the records of vacant and old lands and then buy new stamp papers and create a fake registry on them.
Not only this, the real registry used to disappear and put it on the fake registry record.
Thereafter, the accused used to sell the land on forged documents for crores of rupees.
They used to take loans on these forged documents.
After this, the real owner of the land was left in the lurch of the police and administration.
The accused, who had created a fake registry, used to keep a special watch on the land of NRIs.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIs.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell fake registries of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that during interrogation, the accused revealed that they have prepared around 150 fake registries so far.
According to the police, Rajiv, the kingpin of the gang, has already been booked for fraud and theft.
Protests erupt in Bali over conviction of bomb blast mastermind
The families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bomb blast expressed anguish over the conviction of the mastermind of the blast and said that Umar Patel should face the firing squad.
Patek, who ran away as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the bomb blast.
On parole, he can be released in 15 years.
Umar, 45, was found guilty of mass killing by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounding many.
He was also found guilty of many other terror-related charges, including a series of bomb blasts at a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
"The prosecutors had sought life imprisonment, though they could also demand the death penalty for this man, popularly known as the" "subversive" "master of making the bomb."
This decision revived the painful memories of June Cortin, a woman in Perth, who had lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patak and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his hopes, he said Patel should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
"Ms. Cortin told AAP," "She should be placed in front of the firing team."
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
Just after 11: 00 p.m. on October 12, 2002, the club lost its reputation after an explosion of a bomb loaded in a van parked outside The Sari Club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddys bar exactly 20 seconds before the explosive package was detonated by suicide bombers.
They went into a month-long coma as a result of the bomb blast and died three times while on lifesaving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that Patel should have received the same punishment as three other members of the Jemmah Islamiyah terrorist group Amroji, Muhalas and Imam Samudra who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be sentenced to death before someone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, look, keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, 20 years in prison is not enough.
Patak is the last person to be convicted of one of the Bali bomb blasts.
He survived capture for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the US military killed former Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report revealed that Patel was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
She did not surrender, says Ms. Cortin.
Even today, he does not really have the pain of torturing so many people.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"" "There will be a lot of tears this year."
Pattek can still appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Aircraft passengers can now use gadgets in aircraft (but cannot call from cell phones)
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but not to talk to their cell phones - under the highly anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
Speaking at a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Hurta said how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines have to show the FA how their aircraft complete the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training booklets and devices of their crew members to display the guidelines.
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"" "Based on the status of the scheme, we can approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," "the FAA said in a statement."
At present, passengers are required to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected not to operate until the aircraft reaches a height of 10,000 feet and is allowed by the Captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again at the time of landing, and not turn it on until the aircraft is fully grounded.
"" "Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully safe from electronic disruptions can allow their passengers to use the device while flying, landing and taxing," "the FAA said."
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft which have been modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes.
"" "When the policy is implemented in a safe manner and we will work with airlines to do so, it will be a win-win situation for both sides," "Glading said in a statement."
When it comes to this issue, we are tired of feeling like hall monitors.
But surfing, email exchange, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, will still remain prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airline mode.
So, there will still be no conversation with friends, an online Scrabble game, the famous event associated with which actor Alec Baldwin was flying off the plane in 2011 when he was playing on his smartphone while at the airport park at the door, and was refused to turn off the device by American Airlines.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc., will still have to be collected as they will cause injury to another person in the cabin due to their jumping.
Cell phone calls will also remain prohibited during the flight.
The regulatory authority relating to phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission and not with the FAA.
The FAA may lift restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rogenken of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
"" "Cell phones are really a serious issue, not just because they can potentially cause disruption in navigation devices, but also because they can cause disruption in cell phone towers when in the air," "Rosenker said."
The Industry Advisory Committee constituted by the FAA to examine the issue has recommended last month that the Government should allow greater use of individual electronic devices.
There has been increasing pressure on the FAA in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Claire McCasillac, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
The enforcement of these restrictions is becoming even more difficult as the use of the device is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to close their device.
The FAA began to ban the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when reports of disruption in navigation and communication equipment were received due to FM radio and high technology gadgets carried by passengers at that time.
The new airlines are more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved to be resistant to electronic interference by the FAA.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruise height from passengers for many years.
The aircraft modified for Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to disruption.
Most airlines should meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Hurta said.
Today's electronic devices emit very low power radio transmission as compared to previous generation electronic devices.
For example, e-readers have a very nominal transmission during page flip.
But transmission dominates while downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com is among those who have favoured easing of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems, but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aviation Passenger Association said he believes that the disruption caused by the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the disruption by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the committee members recommended that the FAA allow the pilot to order closure of the device to the passengers at the time of landing in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and described them as a common knowledge facility for the people travelling in the latest era of technology.
"" "We are happy that the FAA has recognized that the passenger travelling with joy is not inconsistent with rescue and safety," "said Roger Doe, CEO, US Travel Association."
Learning from the series of bomb blasts in Patna, the UT police are all set to celebrate Diwali and respond to Quick Reaction during the Emergency.
A total of 1800 soldiers, including vehicles, will patrol all major locations in the city, crowded markets and other places to arrest the perpetrators of other incidents including smooth running of traffic, prevention of snatching incidents, teaching of lessons to the mind and so on.
These personnel will include PCR, traffic unit and women police personnel.
Police personnel and commandos will also carry out record checks at hotels, guest houses and other places in the city with caution.
The SSP has been directed to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the matter.
Further, the DSP along with the Inspector has been entrusted with the responsibility of conducting investigations at markets, malls and other places including VIP sectors in the city.
In view of the emergency situation and Diwali festival, the higher authorities have also fixed additional duties of police personnel in the police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The police have asked the staff of the Fire Department and the PGI Director, Principal Director and DHS, besides the staff of the Sector 16 GMSH and Sector 32 GMCH management, to remain on high alert in case of an emergency.
To teach a lesson to the MNS, the departmental officers have now put women police personnel and others on duty in the name of anti-goonda staff led by the NGO.
The police personnel of the anti-goonda staff team will be on a rampage at crowded places including markets in plain clothes to catch the Manchals.
On Diwali, all SHOs have been ordered to set up 44 nakas in the hinterland of the city.
Police personnel will also be deployed at 38 naka points along the city borders.
The bird was released back into the forest by air to protect it from the North Sea rig
The bird found hanging on the North Sea Oil rig has been airlifted back from the coast to the forest.
The water rail bird was sent to Aberdeen by helicopter before the Scottish SPCA recovered it back to their rescue center in Aloa.
"Central Manager Colin Sedan explained:" "The water rail was probably a winter migratory bird in Northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea."
It seems the bird was tired and took refuge in the oil rig.
"He further added:" "It was unable to fly again so we were approached for help."
Before being released, the water train had become healthy and healthy.
Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with the UK?
Business for the UK was launched in April and a pledge was taken to bring business together and determine what changes we would like to see in our relationship with the UK's Employment and Prosperity Manufacturers EU.
For that, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of the UK business with the EU.
U-Gove took the views of 1000 business leaders, representing the business size, regions and locations of the UK.
The findings of this survey can be surprising to many.
We found that a large part of the businesses now want to export outside Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming motionless.
They want the government to prioritise new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not engage in a long and arduous process of reform of the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked about his views on specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders were of the view that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could have been seen very easily, with businesses saying that the price of regulation of Brussels was much higher than the benefits of being part of the business sector in Europe - even 40 percent of the vast businessmen who had traditionally been in favour of European companies.
Finally and most importantly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large section clearly wants the UK to move on the path of trade based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
"This conclusion, which was seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businesses were driving towards a" "meaningful change" "that would give the UK its lost power back."
It has a very high price the issue of treaty change and getting a better deal for the UK changed 16 percent of the vote in favour of remaining in the EU in the referendum.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: this survey is that British businessmen support his plan to negotiate UKs terms of membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to renegotiate by making a meaningful change to do the current power balance in favour of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly inevitable, as the euro zone is moving towards an integrated economy and a fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show, that for businesses it means a new focused focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory mechanism.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline the beginning of a new era in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said that the beginning of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the beginning of Europes largest energy projects.
Today is a historic event: Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe, Gezprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A dispute between Gazprom's Counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is for Europe, presents a risk for traditional routes, officials said.
"Miller said that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the elimination of geopolitical risks associated with transit countries" "forever." ""
After the entire project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian customers will get gas at concessional rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Royal Commission hears sexual harassment charges against two YMCA employees before charges against Jonathan Lord
Two employees of YMCANSW have been charged with child sexual offences before being charged against Jonathan Lord, a Caringbah child care employee in 2011.
"But in its statement before the Commission, it said it had" "never raised the issue of child sexual abuse within its organisation," "it was informed to the Commission."
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which the YMCA Caringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual abuse against children in his care in 1991.
Advocate Gail Furnes, who assisted the Commission, told Mr Hare that he was aware of the matter earlier but did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the YMCA's statement before the Commission that an external inquiry has been conducted into the YMCA and he has found the YMCA at the forefront of child safety is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Education and Community Department Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is 21 years old with YMCA, admitted that the management, including me, has failed to ensure that the staff is clearly aware of their obligations relating to reporting child safety policy violations to the employees due to the appointment of Lord.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 children during his two year tenure at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
However, Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem due to which the employees did not report any violation of child safety by the Lord.
The employees gave evidence of the violation, including Lord spending time alone with the children, getting them to babysitting in person, telling them that he loves them and allowing them to play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Auckwell, who was under Lord's supervision, and had asked for child protection training, as she was concerned about her behaviour, testified that the YMCA Carringbah, who supervised Lord's child service manager, was very intimidating and difficult to find most of the time.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
He said that rather, his friendship with Lord misled his decision to inform him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his vision to YMCANSW Mandal that the text for the organization from the Jonathan Lord incident was about not providing information.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees was taken immediately after the allegations came to light by William Whitley, General Manager of Child Services, YMCA.
"He said that the objective was to avoid a combination of evidence, but it was" "over-enthusiastic" "and not executed properly."
Stephen Smallbone, Special Professor of Child Sexual Abuse at Griffith University, said that YMCANSW was not a safe organization while Jonathan Lord was on duty between 2099 and 2011.
"He said that there were" "serious problems" "in appointment, monitoring, admission, training and supervision of employees."
The hearing has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like to be the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom again - but he believes there is no chance of making a comeback.
In an overnight interview on the occasion of his fifth anniversary from the Prime Ministers Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007, a decade as a leader, Shri Blair largely refrained from discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a representative of the peace founders of the Middle East group.
"Asked if he would like to return as Prime Minister, Blair was presented by the Evening Standard newspaper of London, saying:" "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts showcasing horses for the best horse of the year had gathered at Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet attended school and a few months after taking his first step, the little boy and his pet Shetland's Tattu Tafy easily completed three phases and received the top prize he surpassed his 30 adult competitors.
In the annual competition organized by the Sunyback Equestrian Center in Rudry, near Cardiff, the unbreakable pair - which is the same length - was highly appreciated for its appearance, behaviour and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful bowler hats, he tarnished his flat cap at the alhad angle and made his two-year-old toffee turn around the ring.
The decision makers praised Fenton for his natural control skills that are far ahead of his age.
And Toffy received the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
The toffee was gifted to Fenton on his third birthday last March, and he has practiced daily with this tattoo of the Shetland since then.
"Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said:" "Fenton and Toffy are a wonderful pair."
He had faced a challenge from all the candidates but both of them won the Gold Cup and the Rosette.
This was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffy, and we are all very happy with his victory.
Separately in this theatre, he was so amazing that he wanted to take a photo with her.
Ab Well, this young child from Nantiglo village near South Wales is walking on the footprints of his aunty Sharon Howells, who have been performing horses for more than 10 years.
"Shrimat Howells said:" "The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating and clapping."
He was running on sand all over the theatre, and despite looking so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is an animal lover he loves horses, tractors, and fields, and he has raised two chickens he takes care of.
The kind of start he has made will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I am confident he will do very well.
"A spokesperson for the annual horse exhibition said:" "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to control his tattoo."
They are a very good pair.
The decision makers gave the points in view of the performance methods of Fenton and Toffy and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw the good team work between Tattu and his rider Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring in this regard.
I am sure Fenton's lovely clothes have helped him, he looked really different.
"The arguing Chinese newspaper will be" "revived" ""
A Chinese newspaper that had made an appeal on the homepage to release a reporter convicted of defamation will be revamped, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express had made a rare public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But then Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write fabricated news about a partially owned company in the state.
"The regulator said that now the New Express has to go through" "complete improvement." ""
The order of reform came from the Guangdong press and publishing, radio, film and television administration.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company Jumleon during the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The editorial management of New Express was in a mess, the regulator said in a statement.
"It said it had decided to" "impose an administrative penalty by cancelling the license of Chen Yongzhou reporter." ""
"It had" "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete reform of the New Express, recommend an investigation into those responsible in the New Express and an immediate modification of the New Express led team." ""
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zumleone.
After his detention, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for his release, saying he supported Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came to state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
"" "In this case, I have harmed Jumleon as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people," "he told state broadcaster CCTV."
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realised my mistake.
After Mr Chen's apology, the New Express issued a cover apology stating that it had failed to properly examine his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have confessed to TV transmission defects.
Experts say that coercion is made from time to time, despite the fact that in the latter half of this year, a law prohibited authorities from forcing a person to blame themselves.
Maninderjit Singh Bitta, National President, Counter-Terrorism Front will recite Shri Hanuman Chalisa with 10,000 children at a lesson of Shri Hanuman Chalisa to be held at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar bypass on 23rd November.

Self-Railways Found in US-Mexico Drug Tunnel
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
US officials have described a four feet three feet tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is equivalent to the perpendicular length of about six football pitches, connecting the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is full of similar warehouses, making it easier to hide a truck being loaded with drugs.
Officials said it was closed before any drug could pass through the tunnel.
According to court records, the authorities have seized eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the exploration of the tunnel.
Three persons, who were working as drivers, were accused of keeping marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing.
If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment.
Smuggles in Nogles, Arizona, take advantage of large underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major tunnel discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the central Mexican marijuana crop in October, posing a challenge to the capable drug mafia groups to quickly deliver the product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found about 700 yards of railway track equipped, extending from the kitchen of a home in Tijuana to the San Diego warehouses.

British police send extradition notice to Assange
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought asylum at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London.
"Scotland Yard said he had sent a" "surrender notice" "to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, and that he would be responsible for his arrest if he failed to do so."
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences and his options under British law came to an end when his appeal against extradition was rejected by the Supreme Court earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the US, he had requested asylum at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
"A spokesperson said that Scotland Yard has" "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, for which he was required to appear at the police station on the date and time we chose." ""
He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on the police notice being served.
Assange fears that with the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-privacy website called Wikileaks, he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges.

When the police stopped them, they found a take-away drink on their feet.
In the Colchester Magistrate Court, Howe has admitted the charge of reckless driving.
Seven points were added to his license, resulting in him being banned from driving for six months.
Hovi was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 pounds (90) and a $100 victim surcharge.
Tax on foreign property owners to end artificial status of London
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who had introduced stamp duty at the rate of 7% in the 2012 budget for houses worth more than 2 million pounds, and individuals who prefer to keep a house in a company instead of a separate person.
The stamp duty received from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea in 2012 / 13 was 708 million, which is already higher than the combined yoga of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hamber.
Mr. Cook said: After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and introduction of Associated Anti-Avoidance Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property has the lowest tax, which has nothing to do with the impact of the outdated Council tax system.
"" "But this move could silence some foreign investors in buying property in London and make them reluctant to sell it to existing owners"
The top 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market in Prime Property, Dhanadya South-West London, which spans Fulham to Wimbledon, has registered a record growth of 11.8 per cent last year.
"According to Savils research, the prices of central London continued to grow by 5.6 per cent every year, but appeared to be slightly lower than the" "domestic market" "as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) were witnessing a surge."
Scientists have shed more light on the relationship between dog tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move more to the right of their tail (from the point of view of the dog), while restless dogs move more mainly their tail to the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can identify this subtle distinction of tail and react to it.
The study has been published in the journal Current Biology.
"Professor Georgia Vallertigra, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said:" "It is well known in humans that the left and right parts of the brain are involved differently in the stimulation that causes positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He pointed out that in dogs, like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for left hand movements and reverse order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral Dog movements by other dogs, the researchers tracked animals watching movies of other dogs.
He measured the heart beats of pet dogs and analysed their behavior.
We probably do not take much time to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side or the other.
"Prof. Vellartigara explained:" "We introduced dogs with dog films in the realistic version or in the shadow to deal with other confusing issues, and we could see tail movement and present the tail more left or right."
When the animals saw a unconscious dog moving its tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they were absolutely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail changing direction mainly to the left (from the point of view of the dog), his heart beat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigara, they do not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what action they should and should not be concerned about.
"He said:" "If you have met other dogs many times, and if they constantly move their tail one side, it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right one presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience."
These findings can provide better information about animal feelings to owners, veterinarians and trainers, the researchers said.
Fellow, a guest fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, dog behavior expert, John Bradshaw, said that this is not the first study to examine whether left or right is important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
"In other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, he explained:" "Unlike Italian studies when the robot dog's tail was moved to the left rather than to the right, dogs were more likely to approach him than to be restless." ""
He said that this difference was because in various studies dogs in films did not fully understand animals or robots dogs as dogs.
He clarified that the study of the way dogs react to real dogs can help.
"While there is considerable evidence from various mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is yet to be obtained and dogs are no exception in this case," "he said."
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we probably do not take much time to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side or the other.
Arctic Monkey postpones Glasgow Gigg due to Alex Turner's illness
Arctic Monkey, a rock bank, has postponed Gigg in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered from throat pain.
On Friday, the schedule of the Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro site in the city.

Pope Francis to announce first cardinal in February
The Vatican on Thursday announced that Pope Francis would build a new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
The Cardinals, the highest class of priests in the Catholic Church, have only a position below the pope, and are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his individuals, who will eventually help him choose his successor.
At present, there are 201 cardinals in total.
"However, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pope's election - he belongs to a group of 120" "cardinal electors." ""
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the celebration of the promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, called the Pop-Sabha.
"" "Pope Francis has decided to predict his decision to hold the Pop-Council in February, so as to make it easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world," "Lombardy said."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
He said that the popes generally name cardinals as low as the number of cardinal electors as less than 120, and cardinals above 80 years of age as they wish.
Valero said that the next years papal meeting would be important, as it would be the first papal meeting after Francis was elected in March this year.
There is currently a kind of prejudice against Europe and especially Italy.
It will be interesting to see if the new popes nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance.
In South America, 40 percent of Roman Catholics are present, but their number in cardinals is very low.
These cardinals will also be the first cardinals to be elected by Francis after the formation of the Cardinals Council, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose function is to find ways to reform the church.
Earlier, the pope used to decide everything on his own.
"" "At present Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," "Valero said."
"He said it was" "possible" "to seek advice from Francis Cardinals."
But we have not been in this situation before - this is absolutely new.
"Valero said that the popes generally give cardinals to bishops in large places, but Francis was" "absolutely astounding" so we don't know who they will announce. "
GM calls back pickup trucks in US to correct seat back
According to a information received from US auto safety regulators on Friday, General Motors has recalled about 19,000 trucks to correct a shortfall in handheld seatback in its 2014 Chevrolet Silverdo and GMC Sira pickup trucks
There may be a reduction in the front seat rotation system in some trucks.
As a result, the association failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding seat back, head resistance.
"According to a information posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration," "If the vehicle gets stuck from behind, it is possible that the head should not be able to properly protect the driver, thereby increasing the risk of injury." ""
The recall models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks began to be dispatched in June and, after the 2009 Diwali renewal, this shows the most important Wuhan launch for the top US automaker
GM had informed the truck owners about the fault in late October.
Swamy could not review the notification letter due to the 16 day government prisoner who had disrupted the growth in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that there was a 20 per cent increase in sales of silverdo and sera trucks which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sira pickup trucks
On Friday afternoon, GM shares rose 1.4 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange.
Obamas voters cry for disappointment
I voted for Obama twice in the hope of change
He said Obamas great efforts have been hampered by the GOP's obstruction policy
Obamacare policy cannot excuse drone attacks, harassment of Obamacare website
The memoir of the 2008 Obama campaign reminds us of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books these days.
This is a book about which I think it will excite me during the second year of medical school sadness and give me a ray of hope.
"It has the" "courage to win," "and is a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign."
When I am able to walk through the pamphlets of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could hold you back from breathing.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical significance of the time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents preserved every newspaper they met.
A group of young visionary men were going to the White House, and the entire country was ready for change.
During Obama's presidency in 2008, he had a approval rating of 82 per cent.
And then I closed the book.
The present truth is a harsh truth, such as coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to recall those days of hope they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
The real change took place after I voted for the first time.
Simply put, none of this could have been imagined.
"I give credit to Obama for many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our army from Iraq, from the end of" "Don't ask" "to the killing of Osama bin Laden."
In addition, I believe that the policy of partisan opposition has prevented many efforts for our country to move forward: immigration reform, public options for healthcare, closure of Guantanamo Bay, and so on.
But a number of times when I took favour of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I have the answer that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The Republican opposition policy is not an answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is it an answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data on the personal life of ordinary American citizens, nor to prosecute those exposing the misdeeds of the government.
It cannot explain the cause of the killing of American citizen Anwar El Avalaki without a trial, nor the diminishing public funding and expenditure limits during the presidential campaign.
"This cannot answer the findings of the report that says that attempts by the White House to silence the media have been" "the most aggressive since the Nixon administration." ""
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of its signing in the law of the Affordable Care Act.
I dont know if I expected this.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could refute the political campaign to bring it forward.
It is evident that the elected office is not a predictable route, as the opposition political party and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public discourse.
Yet all the examples I have given above seem to have been largely chosen by the administration.
This bothers you the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidature.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not appear to be a determining of his policies or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obamas estimated rating is less than 45 per cent this week, it has become very difficult to return in 2008 through that book.
Seeing him reminds me of his missing promises.
This week, a part of the book was being read, describing how Clinton did not suffer much due to Obama at the Pennsylvania Primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they needed to return on track, and remain honest with their objectives.
"" "I want to get my Mojo back," "he said."
We should remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that PM Tony Abbott's interest in parental leave plan is conflict of interest
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that the interest of Prime Minister Tony Abbott on the maternity leave scheme is a struggle as his daughters can get pregnant and take advantage of it.
Dignitaries in the mining sector, who are in dispute over payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, have claimed, while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
Palmer could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in determining the reduction of carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from policies.
"Mr Palmer said," "In case of paid parental leave, they may have an important interest in conflict, as if any of their daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not." ""
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer as the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after falling again.
Shri Palmer sought restoration of the counting of elections to expedite the process.
Tony Aot's daughters Franz and Bridget.
Should the outcome of the election come two months after we vote?
"" "We should have a better system."
Why cant we have a system in which we fill our returns on the computer, vote immediately and have results at 6: 30 pm?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencil to mark ballot papers.
This is because if a person does not like it, the money can erase it?
Today, the use of pencil seems absurd.
The Election Commission is studying the options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a Joint Discussion Paper with New Zealand.
"Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his policies included the creation of an international airport for Sunshine Coast, and that he would" "take his new task very seriously." ""
Public office is for public service.
"" "We do not need any awards other than the award of history that we can serve the community at this critical time."
This caused inconvenience to the litigants.
Addressing the gathering, Bar Association president Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his anguish over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said that the rapidly increasing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that criminals are becoming fearless.
They are not afraid of the police and the administration.
Referring to such recent incidents at different places, he said that when the advocacy community is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily gauged.
RBS suspends two forex traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two of its foreign exchange department traders, receiving information from two knowledgeable persons in the case, another indication that global scrutiny by regulators in suspicious currency market manipulation is progressing at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are collaborating with regulators to investigate the worlds largest financial market with a daily exchange of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS to be suspended as the investigation into a case that appears to be a repeat of the Libor inter-bank loan default case continues.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension and confirmed that it has received a request for information from regulators this month.
"" "We are investigating the matter, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," "the bank had said two weeks ago."
Last month, knowledgeable people in the case had said that RBS had sent emails and instant messages received from the former trader to the UK regulator, Financial Ethics Authority.
The trader, Richard Yusher, had left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been removed from its current position of European Chief of Forex Spot Trading in J. P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot trading in the city, went on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts in the matter informed that Mr. Yushars quick message group includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it has taken action this week against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, reported that it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation in many Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities the European Commission, the Competition Authority of Finland, Switzerland, the WCO, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority-Bankers are investigating allegations of misappropriation of currency market to bring about their favourable volatility.
Those familiar with the case said that HSBC, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also carried out internal investigations, or have received requests for information from regulators.
Banks are closely checking instant messages and emails, equivalent to years, in search of clues for any wrong activity.
On investigation, the news has created a stir among traders in an area that has been one of the leading beneficiaries of the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing the challenge this year as opportunities for speculators have come down due to low fluctuations in currencies.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it was impossible to manipulate the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it was not necessary to be true.
"The senior trader said that despite the huge quantum of foreign exchange purchases and sales, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and increasing use of their own platform by banks means" "you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price." ""
The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced this week's retirement from its exchange traded funds desk in London, which had lost nearly $6 million at the end of the previous year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is collaborating with its regulators.
"Credit Suisse said," "We are confident that the trader worked alone, and has been controlled."
Students studying in technical and management courses in the campus will be able to exercise their franchise this time.

People have been buying utensils, gold and silver items in the capital on Dhanteras.
Such purchases have increased by 20-30% over the previous year.
In Shimla, people thronged jewellery shops.
There was also a huge crowd at utensils shops decorated from Lower Bazar to Malroad.
Though inflation continues to be on the rise this year, people still did not show any hesitation in shopping at the auspicious time.
The auspicious time for shopping on Friday was from 7: 52 am to 10: 12 am and 1: 56 to 3: 37 am and 6: 17 am to 8: 12 am.
At the time of the said three moments, a large number of people gathered in the suburbs including Shimla for more shopping.
In Shimla Lower Bazar, people could not find a place to walk.

Dhanteras is celebrated as the Trayodashi Tithi, Krishna Paksha in the month of Kartik.
Supreme Court Supports Obama Healthcare Act
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
5-4 By vote, the Judges ruled in favour of a separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act which would require citizens to buy or punish health insurance before 2014 that it was constitutional under the power of the Government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thomas, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court has also supported the remaining articles of the 2700-page Act, and said that the condition of the healthcare law that states increase Medicaid eligibility or they will lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought in by 26 States and National Association of Independent Professionals to quell the Act.
During the initial session of 2012, the law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including the hypothetical nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that we cannot work without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to accept it all.
Dhanteras is celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Kartik.
Dhanteras is worshipped as the god of wealth, Kuber and Yamraj, the god of death.
Money plays a vital role in our lives and religion.
No money is good or bad.
Our feelings for money are good and bad.
There cannot be anything more valuable than the money that has been used for the welfare of humanity, but the money that has become the cause of ego has no meaning.
Let us earn money for the holy purpose and spend it for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some of this should also have a sense of spending on the society, but the activity of collecting unaccounted wealth or earning yen - cane wealth destroys our conscience and personality.
The spirit of giving should always be in the mind.
Even a fraction of the money you have given can become the basis of someones life.
We all should think about the fact that many people in the society are living in dire straits.
In fact, the men of life have given equal importance to meaning, religion, work and salvation.
Everyone wants money and fame and according to their hard work they get money and fame.
The same wealth is sustainable with which respect is associated.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he cannot enjoy it properly or be useful to others.
If someone else has money, do not envy him.
The true rich are those who make the way into the countless hands of wealth.
There can be no better utilization of money than generation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not just in the form of currency.
It would also have been your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of this money.

The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed a day before the 2012 PMT scam.
The STF has found irregularities in the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
Out of these, about 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admission of these students may be cancelled.
Following the STF revelation, the Medical Education Department has started brainstorming to cancel the admission of these students.
According to information, the department is waiting for the list of all these suspected students to meet the STF.
The list will be sent to Vyapam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this regard.
Departmental officials say that since it has been one year since the students enrolled in 2012, it is necessary to seek legal advice in this regard.
Medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything as the matter is limited to STF investigation.
Vyapam operator Tarun Pithore said if the STF submits a list of suspected students with evidence, their admission will be cancelled immediately.
Director Medical Education Dr Nirbhay Srivastava said that the students have not even refused to cancel their admission if they are found to be fake admission.
According to STF officials, fake students involved in PMT in 2012 are being investigated.
After investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
It may be recalled that Vyapam had disqualified 345 suspected students who appeared in the PMT examination held in 2013.
Out of these 345, the Medical Education Department has so far cancelled 84 admissions.
Ajaz Jan, MLA, Poonch Assembly constituency, inaugurated the water cooler at the gurdwara premises.
The MLA said a large number of people used to visit the gurdwara but due to lack of proper drinking water facilities, water coolers have been installed here.

Pure water will be available during the winter season.
This will solve the problem of drinking water to the devotees visiting the temple.
Members of the Gurdwara Committee along with others were present on the occasion.
After the general elections, if the new government continues with the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, half a dozen states will not get kerosene at these shops.
The states where the sale of kerosene is to stop are Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, the sale of kerosene is also set to stop in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some northeastern states.
According to Petroleum Ministry sources, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two basis.
First of all, electricity connections are being made at a rapid pace in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, sale of PDS Kerosene is being stopped in most of the rural households in which LPG connections have been given.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has made elaborate arrangements in this regard.
The sale of PDS Kerosene in Delhi has already stopped since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota has been significantly reduced in Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
Punjab's quota has been reduced from 2.72 lakh kilolitres to 1 lakh kilolitres.
The allocation for Uttarakhand has been reduced by 70 per cent and that of Haryana by about 40 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there has been no news of shortage of kerosene from these states.
The Ministry is of the view that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
At present, there is a difference of Rs 37 between the price of PDS Kerosene and Diesel.
This encourages adulterators.
In states where PDS sales are stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are incurring losses of more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The kerosene subsidy burden in 2013-14 is estimated to be around Rs. 31,000 crore.
The accused used to open the accounts of investors citing a trading firm and cheat in the name of sale and purchase of shares.
This is perhaps the first time that such a revelation has come to light in the state that crores of rupees have been cheated.
The police are yet to reach who is the kingpin of the gang, but seven people, including the accused, have been detained by the police in the state.
The gang used to run a fake commodity market in the name of Metatred-5.
The officials of the company used to take cash from the investors and create fake IDs on a fake software.
As a result, the shares purchased by the investors on trading were seen by the accused.
It even knew which shares were purchased at what price.
In fact, no shares were purchased and there was no transaction as no demat account of investors was opened and shares were shown to be false on this fake software.
The police suspect that hundreds of people were involved in the crime.
An investment of Rs. 2 to 5 lakh was made in the name of making profits from each investor.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur while six of his associates have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohre, any trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after this, the company can get investors to do share trading through it.
The demat account of the investor is then opened so that shares can be purchased and sold for it, but the company called Metatred-5 was neither associated with any exchange nor engaged in stock trading.
The company had purchased the server for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of Wintage.
Since then, people have been being lured into investing in the name of this company.
At present, eight traders from Indore have come forward to lodge a complaint with the cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profit, their money was not transferred to the account.
On this, he started asking for profit from the company officials.
Investors are even saying that on the fake ID given to them, the price of their purchased shares was always low.
This price was fixed by the accused at their own level.
The company has appointed CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
The agents advised people to join the company by luring people with more profits.
After that, they used to deposit up to two lakh rupees from someone and up to five lakh rupees from someone.

BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Congress while addressing an election rally in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital.
"" "In many states and at the Centre, sometimes there was a coalition government, sometimes there was a Congress government, sometimes there was a BJP government."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
There should be certain parameters in the country.
What did the party do?
If there is a comparative result, there will be no question before the country whether a BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government has been formed, efforts have been made to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
This country is a witness to the fact that inflation was low under the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man used to get food twice.
But when the Congress formed the government or its support, the poor did not get enough to eat.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader, is responding to what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media of our country are not able to reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
He did not speak to media.
Elections are of the Lok Sabha, you should answer to the people.
Hitting out at Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi said, Modi is being asked questions these days.
In a democracy, servants should sit, not rulers, in Delhi.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves there.
Congress friends leave balloons every day.
Congress friends, we have taken the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, people do.
A case has been registered against Google, Samsung and Huawei in connection with the Nortel patent case.
The group, owned by thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed a number of patent cases against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, which it had outperformed in the Nortel insolvency auction.
Rockstar, an association that bought Nortel patents for 4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The prosecution said these patents also include technology that combines the words being searched on the internet with words in relevant advertising, which is a key part of Googles search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be immediately contacted.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC all make phones that run Googles Android operating system that compete with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google had made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel Patents.
Google finally proposed $4.4 billion by increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar at Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons for Motorola to have a long list of patents.
"" "Despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suite at the auction, Google has violated, and has been continuously violating," "the charge said"
Rockstar has sought enhanced compensation against Google as it is alleged that the breach of patents by Google is malicious.
Confidence in the first President independently elected in Egypt
Mohamed Morsi has taken oath of office, but his victory day hardly ended the political struggle in Egypt.
"Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a" "new Egypt" "while taking oath as the country's first independently elected president to replace ousted Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago."
On its formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arab became the first independently elected Islamic President of the world, and the fifth Head of State of Egypt after the removal of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office on his chair before 18 judges of the court, who looked like an ancient Egyptian temple, on the banks of the Nile.
"" "We look forward to a better future, a new Egypt and another republic," "Morsi said at a formal ceremony on live broadcast on national television."
"The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has lived as an illegal declared organization for 84 years since its inception, and which has been targeted by previous governments, said 60 - year - old Morsi, the party's trained engineer in the US, said that" "today the Egyptians have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability." ""
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and, as per local time, came to Morsi in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 am.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new President, apart from the President's pomp, so that his motor convoy could pass through a generally busy road connecting the city's center to its southern suburbs.
"Morsi's personal reputation, which has been ridiculed as a non-charismatic" "empty tyre" "of the Brotherhood, grew greatly after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate for all who want to complete the 2011 revolution against dictatorial Mubarak."
Wearing a blue business suit and red tie, Morsi took oath of office before judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation today.
He then moved to the University of Cairo, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was accorded a ceremonial welcome by the military band playing the national anthem, while standing in a cautious posture.
The military ruler, Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi, was also present.
"On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed him with the slogan" "Army and people are one hand." ""
Established in 1908 as a hub of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath at Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and took a pledge to withdraw President's powers that were removed by the military council last year.
But by traditionally agreeing to take an official oath before the court instead of taking an able oath of Parliament, they bowed to the will of the Army, indicating that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases US espionage had crossed the limit.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.

"" "I assure you that innocent people are not being harassed in this process."
But in some cases, inappropriate methods have been adopted in an attempt to get information.
Meanwhile, a key Congressional committee has approved a bill restricting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The objective is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the confidence of the people that has been hurt by the large scale phone tapping.
The move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google and Yahoo.
The NSA has also breached the data centres of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Monitoring Reform Bill (FISA) on the NSA by four votes against 11.
The bill provides for a number of restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone tapes, under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, deliberate and unauthorized data collection and its use will be treated as an offence and provision for imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years.
The Bill will become law after both the Houses of Parliament pass by the House of Representatives and the Senate.
"" "The NSA phone recording programme is under the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country," "Committee Chairman and Senator Diane Festival said."
But despite this, more transparency should be brought in.
At the same time, the privacy of the people should also be protected.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported the bill over the disclosure of the NSA's internet surveillance programme.
In a letter to Senators, the companies said, We welcome the proposal of MPs to ban large scale phone recording of NSA.
It may be recalled that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden had exposed the NSA's actions.
There has been considerable resentment in the international community after the NSA revealed monitoring of the telephonic conversations of Heads of State and Government of 35 countries, including Germany and France.

A recent media report said that the NSA had used information from Yahoo and Google data centres for spying.
The Washington Post has made the revelation on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA program was named Muscular, which it ran in collaboration with its British counter part-GCHQ.
Both the agencies stole data from Yahoo and Googles vast fibre optic cable network.
The Washington Post quoted a top secret document of January 9, 2013, as saying that more than 18 crore documents were collected within three days of the launch of the programme.
These include emails, text messages, audio and video messages.
The program was run outside the United States, and a benami telecommunication provider helped the NSA reach out to this information, according to the Washington Post.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run the programme outside the US as court orders are required for such operations in the US.
"" "As far as I know, this has never happened," "NSA Chief General Keith Alexander said at a press conference in Washington."
The NSA has always collected all the information within the ambit of the law.
The NSA had recently targeted the German Chancellor for spying.

Schools seek greater focus on Mathematics, Spelling and Grammar
In English literature courses, students must at least read Shakespeares play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
"The exam will also include" "unread text" "to encourage more and more reading."
A joint English literature and language course will be abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take a separate GCSE in language, and there will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow both these will be the first subjects to bring about revolutionary changes.
It will also transform other major themes next year.
In a different step, the examination regulators will showcase the changes in the structure of GCSE with offline, new grading system, and low curriculum.
Speaking in the summer, Secretary of Education Michael Gove had said that there was a lot of consensus that in order to restore the confidence of the people, we need to improve our examination system, he said, adding that GCSE will be more challenging, more ambitious and more stringent.
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics 116 hours a year or 3 hours a week during the session as compared to most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools provide students an average of 143 hours in a year, while Singapore averages 138 hours.
While there would be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that the integration of comprehensive mathematics with subjects in the GCSE-League table was likely to encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
"The course will focus more on" "real world problems" "including financial mathematics."

These people are tarnishing his image and reporting unilaterally.
Asarams rights should be protected in this case.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asarams counsel that he had other legal remedies that he could use.
Questioned by the opposition at the railway gate, Pawan Bansal put the opposition in a dilemma by saying that he had not looked at anyone's woman in 15 years.
Everyone was surprised as to where the woman came from.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a corporator.
Turning the matter aside, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had planned to lodge a complaint against a woman behind him during the last parliamentary elections, which could not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said he has been questioned by the CBI in connection with a railway bribery case.
If they are made witnesses in the case, will they be made only after thorough investigation?
Bansal said he had definitely written a letter to only one needy person in the booth where they are talking about the scam.
If this is their crime, they will always commit such a crime.
He said though the corporation had no constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as development works are concerned, the opposition will be given a list of development works for 15 years.
These people cannot even think of the way Chandigarh is being developed or is going to be.
The Cabinet meeting exchanged greetings between the two sides.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Ministers speech for his counter attack on Narendra Modi at the Chintan camp.
He also said that he has no other feelings in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges need to be addressed.
The Chief Minister also had the same feeling on his face that he took Singhs speech positively.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to honour the workers at the Chintan camp and protect them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to be sacked from the Cabinet to express his views.
However, after the opinion raised in the Chintan Shivir, there is a possibility of fresh consideration in the matter of hiring workers in government posts.
At the camp, state JD (U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers in the 20-point committees would be announced soon.
His indication was that the list was almost ready.
It is being reported that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will inspect the list from his own level.
They will also examine whether the views of the MLAs and MPs have been taken into account in the list.
The list will be revised in a big way to accommodate old and committed workers, if required.
The MLAs and MPs have generally alleged that their views were not taken in the list of nominations.
Names of people who came much later from other parties have been included in the list while many important activists active since the days of Samta Party have remained neglected.
Some people are born with silver spun, some with their hard work make life ideal and people take inspiration from them.
One such person is Late Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardas Ambani, was born on December 28, 1932, in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat.
Dhirubhai was the third of five siblings.
The five children in the family are Ramaniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilokana and Jasumathi.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to drop out of school only after high school.
Dhirubhai started providing financial assistance to the house at a young age.
At that time he used to set up a grocery shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
His first job was in 1949, at the age of 17, on a ship called Kabota that reached Aden, Yemen.
Here his elder brother Ramaniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem in getting a job abroad.
But Dhirubhai had something else in his mind.
So in 1954 they returned home.
In 1955, he put Rs 500 in his pocket and reached Mumbai to try his luck.
And this is where his business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such a step that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
He was the owner of Rs 62,000 crore at that time.
His sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are currently ruling the country.
Today, like their father, these two brothers are also among the international businessmen.
Who doesnt know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai Ambani, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani.

According to sources, in the recent resource committee meeting, out of several tax proposals, the committee rejected them, which had a direct impact on the general public.
However, the Committee has approved the proposal to increase tax on mosquito repellents, quails, mats and liquids.
The tax on them is proposed to be tripled.
At present, they are taxed at 4 per cent and 1 per cent.
Now they are proposed to be taxed at 12.50 per cent and 1.50 per cent.
The Government is estimated to get an additional revenue of about Rs. 14 crore.
Proposal to increase tax on tendu leaf rejected: Though the Commercial Tax Department has been in favour of increasing the tax rate on tendu leaf from 5% to 14% to increase the tax revenue income, the Financial Resources Committee has rejected the proposal.
The Committee is of the view that tendu leaf is used to make bidi which is consumed by people from lower strata.
Similarly, the Committee has not yet given its nod to increase tax on electrical goods like transmission wires, etc., to say that this may have an impact on the general public due to high cost of electricity.
The Committee has also not accepted the proposal to impose Green Tax on renewal of commercial vehicles.

Srinagar: Police have reportedly withdrawn the security cover of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security has been withdrawn for political reasons.
Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who won the 2002 elections on a PDP ticket from Shopian, was a minister in his cabinet when he was the chief minister.
I have been with the security cover since 1996.
I live in Shopian, a stronghold of terrorists.
A CRPF security team led by a sub-inspector was deployed at my house.
I also have bodyguards with me, but on Thursday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security forces were leaving my house, I spoke to the Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir, Abdul Ghani Mir, denied having any information about the matter and said it was a sensitive matter.
I will personally examine how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has been withdrawn.
State Congress chief Prof Saifuddin Soz said, I have no such information.
If the security of Hasan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am in Jammu at present I am coming to Kashmir in the next one or two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore in the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Rather, contrary to Modis claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004) when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, there was a time when for two consecutive years (2001-2002) there was no advertisement issued by the government against Patel.
Laying the foundation stone of the 182-metre tall Statue of Unity in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, Earlier, there was no advertisement on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel
The DAVP records show that the UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patels advertisements.
When asked about Modi's claims, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said the BJP's PM candidates do not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
This was due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patels advertisements is much less than the amount spent every year on the birth and death anniversaries of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for the birth and death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
"" "When asked about the difference, Manish Tewari said," "" "This should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertising." ""
Because the cost of advertising depends on a number of things, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of advertisement for that year etc.
The fact is that this shows our dedication, which those opposing are trying to carry on the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed at a rally in Patna last Sunday.
Tight security arrangements have been made in view of PM Narendra Modi's visit.
Police thoroughly inspected the routes and meeting places of Modi's visit.
People coming to the meeting will be watched by the police.
Gujarat Police Force, NSG and State Police will keep a watch on the security.
Modi's security will be further tightened.
Meanwhile, questions are also being raised about the BJP's bust Kalash Yatra over the people killed in the Patna blast.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has blamed the BJP for inciting violence.
Moving forward through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr.Georges Well is providing free health care in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not many doctors in West African countries. There is only one doctor for 5000 people.
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. George Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or anyone in the other top 10 to become the hero of the CNN year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years, George Well saw his ailing father coming to his senses and going to the hospital, unconscious, who was not adequately equipped to help him.
Jamel Wale was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital Yonde in 1981.
Initially only his hand was broken, but an infection increased which spread to his brain, and he produced blood cancer, which affected the rest of his life.
"" "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon," "says George Vale."
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Vale continued to visit the overcrowded clinics and hospitals with his father and receive whatever treatment he could receive.
Its not easy, he said.
You leave home at 5 am in the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but that does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can fall into the death while waiting.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Vels father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5000 people.
In comparison, there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many Cameroon residents cannot afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two thirds of the healthcare expenditure in the country is in the private sector.
"" "Their only problem is poverty."
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Vale resolved to solve it.
Dr. George and his team of volunteers have undergone 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a doctor, and worked as a vascular surgeon at Yonde's Center Hospital.
And they started the non-profit organization Escowim, which goes to rural areas over the weekend to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle more than once through rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they actually get the hero's respect: dinner, singing and dancing, and the best residence that can be performed by the community.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason to celebrate, and the well - with its great smile and endless energy - is happily involved.
The next morning his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
"" "We are meeting 500 people on each trip."
They come from a distance of about 60 km from the village, and come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get Baisakhi, donated glasses or free birth certificates -- this document is required in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgeries with spatial anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed at school buildings, town halls or at home after the process, the patient walks to the recovery site, and makes space for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes operation rooms and sanitizing equipment, and the well and their volunteers get up early on Sunday morning and work.
This is a tremendous speed, but village musicians generally help keep the team motivated.
"" "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and keep our work going," "Vale said."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group, including Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, has undergone 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their support can change the world of people they support.
One person said that he would be able to go back to work due to free hernia surgery.
"" "This will change the future of me and my family."
Apart from running the clinic over the weekend and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Vale also works in a private medical clinic around the compound at night.
He informed that this is his second job which funded 60% of his non-profit work and the rest is completed by private donations.
"" "I don't know when they sleep," "said Katy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at the University of Dracell in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the group of Vale."
They are always either in hospitals, or trying to earn money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
This is an experimental opportunity for medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Wale's campaign, which they can never achieve in their country.
"" "We have been able to gain experimental experience in surgeries that help us catch tools for Dr. Well or clean blood stains," "O'Malley said."
As a second year medical student in the US, you will never get a chance to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend from themselves to reach Cameroon, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
But after reaching Yondas, their stay and expenses of instructions are borne by them.
"" "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For Vale, the burden of almost the same work is not difficult.
Helping others lead a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that make them very happy.
"" "I am very happy to do this work," "says Vale."
And I think of my father.
I hope they are seeing what I am doing.
I am doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

You might not believe it but it is true.

"Addressing a rally, Modi said," "If you look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, you will find that they don't talk about what they have done."
"" "Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer the questions of the media."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs an answer from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the people.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants an environment where he gives his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to debate face to face.

Obamas healthcare proposal withdrawn
"Amid the storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday withdrew his frequently repeated misleading promise that" "you can continue if you like your health plan." ""
Along with millions of people receiving cancellation information from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the President for misleading American citizens in recent days.
Yesterday Obama changed his real message.
"In a speech in Boston, he said that" "a lot of people who have health insurance, and it is useful, can continue to do so." ""
"Addressing what he calls the" "news storm," "Obama has favoured buying new coverage in the market from US citizens receiving these information."
Most people will be able to get a better deal, a comprehensive healthcare scheme cheaper than money or proposed.
"" "You will get a better deal."
The administration has said that it should not be surprising that 5% of the population who buys insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage is not in line with the desired standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said," "I tell these American citizens directly" "you deserve better."
"Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market since October has been" "unfortunate." ""
"" "I am as disappointed and angry as anyone else," "he said."
I want to regain your faith.
After a heated argument with the Republicans, Sabelius angrily said this sentence to a colleague sitting behind him at the House hearing yesterday, which was caught by a Mike, about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
"In a more than three hour long hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the" "architect" "of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans."

A proposal in this regard has been sent to the government by the ADA.
This historic city, surrounded by the Ganga-Yamuna on three sides, is no longer left with a plot of land on which the ADA can make a major residential plan.

Even though Asaram is in jail here in India and his devotees are moving away from him, this is not the case in the US at all.
At the ashram in New Jersey, devotees are still visiting the ashram as before.
"In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said that the US spy has" "gone too far" "
"John Kerry has indicated that the U.S. protective attitude on his surveillance program has softened by accepting the unexpected form that its espionage" "sometimes goes too far." ""
"The Minister of State has also admitted that he along with Barack Obama is also guilty of being on an" "automated pilot" "as a rebellious disclosure to informer Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities."
This discovery has brought a diplomatic earthquake to the U.S. government in relations with its allies.
Speaking through video link at the Open Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: There is no question that the President, I, and others in the Government, really knew about some of what would happen to the automatic pilot, because back, it had the potential in the difficult years of World War II, and the Cold War, and then, of course, 9 / 11.
He has become the first high class member of the US government to acknowledge that US espionage has crossed its borders, but has stressed that nobody's rights have been misused.
"He said:" "In some cases, it has gone far beyond improperly."
And the President is determined to make this clear to the people and is currently conducting a thorough review so that no person feels abused.
I assure you that nothing is wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that however, the NSA was striving for a good purpose, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
"" "We are facing a world where people are ready to fly themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world, committed to killing people and attacking governments.
So what is the problem if you are able to prevent it before it happens?
We have actually saved the aircraft from falling, building collapse, and killing people as we have been able to know in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that US lawmakers will go to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called US espionage, and will try to convince European countries about the need to continue the anti-corruption efforts jointly with the US.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about the threats of his involvement in counter-terrorism organisations due to frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"" "For US national security interests, it is really important that European countries are with us in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts," "Murphy, who was elected for the first time and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on European Affairs, told Washington."
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA programme.
Reports of NSA recording millions of phone conversations in Europe have brought bitterness in relations with some of the U.S. allies, though the agency chief said that these reports were not entirely true, and reflected the misunderstanding of metadata shared by NATO allies with the United Nations.
Other disclosures in the documents leaked by Snowden show that the NSA has monitored cell phones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the spying incident on allies, calling it necessary and said it was common for both sides to do so.
Amidst the ruckus, Murphy said his office was arranging a Congress visit which is likely to be held this year, and expressed hope that the delegation would include members from both the parties and both the Chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers will be released in the coming days.
He said that work is still underway on the Yatra programme.
"While Murphy said the purpose of the visit was to improve relations, he said that some" "impractical relationships" "would also have to be abandoned."
He said that European leaders, along with their people, must be honest with their espionage programmes that have been used over the years.
"" "Although we can modify our monitoring program to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," "Murphy said."
During this weekend, Mr Kerry is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will address the hatred about US surveillance activities from the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new politics of change of board in municipalities has begun.
Recently, the Congress-led board in Sainthia Municipality in Birbhum district was converted into a board of TMC due to the change of party of Congress leaders.
This change took place as most of the Congress corporators, including the municipal chairman, joined the TMC.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors of CPI (M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also come down heavily on the TMC here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy sees this as a good sign for the party.
He said 10 Congress councillors, including Santhia Municipality Chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Biplab Dutta, joined the TMC.
Some Left councillors, including the CPI (M), have also held the TMC flag.
All of them have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the TMC and according to the number force, the Sainthia Municipality Board has also come under the control of the TMC.
Shri Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the roadmap for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, CPI (M), CPI, and Forward Bloc are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
Qualified leaders of any party are welcome to the TMC.
The TMC's capture of the municipal board is considered important in political circles due to the defection of Congress corporators in the Sainthia municipality ahead of the November 22 municipal elections.
Earlier, the Left Front ruled Haldia and Nadia also had an example of TMC occupying the Congress-ruled municipal board.
When the TMC takes over the municipal board in the districts due to defection, those who join the party get a grand welcome at the TMC building in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to break away from other parties and join the TMC.
He said those who have broken away from any party are welcome to the TMC.
He claimed that the faith of the people is increasing under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, as a result of which people want to join the TMC.
However, the main opposition CPI (M) says leaders at the grassroots level of other parties are being threatened.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress fearing terror.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is a blow to democracy by the CPI (M).
In a democratic manner, any party has the right to expand its base but the rationale for a change of opinion on power is bound to be questioned.
Australian woman appeals against Thai prison term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly accusing the taxi driver of assaulting her, appealing against the decision and getting bail.
On June 15, the Fuket provincial court found Steve Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false allegations against the Thai police, alleging that on the morning of Sunday, June 10, a local taxi driver, along with two other persons, tried to stop him.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned to the hotel safely after separation from her Australian boyfriend.
Fuket confessed to fabricating the story when he was questioned by the police for two days.
He was kept in a local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the outskirts of Fuket instead of an adult female prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help his daughter.
"Tux told the Sunday Telegraph of Sydney that the entire family was" "deeply concerned" "about the care of their daughter and wanted to call her back to Australia."
"" "It has undoubtedly been a worrying time for us, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible."
Bamford has appealed against the sentence order, and has been granted bail on 50,000 Baht.
Meanwhile, the report in Australia said that she was holidaying at the crabi holiday destination in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in Fuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend its sentence to two years and compel him to remain in an adult prison.
Similarly, after the recent killing of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand could also be exonerated in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
