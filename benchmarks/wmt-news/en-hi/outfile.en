Black box in your car?
While American road planners are struggling with a lack of money to improve the collapsed highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box that fits clearly on the dashboard of your car.
The device, which tracks every mile driving by the motorist and transmits that information to the authorities, has now become a contentious issue for Washington and the State Planning Office to revive the outdated system to finance major roads in the United States.
Generally, boring work like highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
You have joined Libertarian environmental groups to garner support in favour of allowing the government to use these black boxes, miles you drive, and possibly keep details of the place you drive - and then use this information to prepare a tax bill.
Tea party is a beacon.
The US Civil Freedom Association is also deeply concerned by raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether further action should be taken or not, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can go into a system in the next decade in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorcyclists have already taken black boxes for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is really essential for our country.
"It is not a matter of our choice," "says Hasan Ikhrta, executive director of the South California Government Association, who is planning to start tracking every mile decided by motorists in California by 2025."
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do so.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost become insolvent, funded by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by US citizens.
Americans no longer buy as much gas as they used to.
Now the car runs more miles than before in a gallon gas.
There has been no increase in Federal Tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to high gas prices, politicians also refrain from increasing the tax by a single penny.
"" "Gas tax is not affordable at all," "says Lee Munich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota."
His State has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per mile payment system.
"" "In the long run, it will act as the most rational option."
Vonx calls it mileage based user charges.
It is not surprising that this idea is good for urban liberals, as it can, for example, change taxes to change the way cars are driven, which can help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gas.
The California planners are keen to this system while developing strategies to meet the targets set in the states ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (A-PA) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
"Adrian Moore, vice president of the policy in the region, said," "This is not just a tax that is going into a blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 had favoured moving from the Congress towards per mile payment.
The US Senate had approved a $90-million test project last year involving 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of the rural law makers, who were representing persons who had to walk a lot of miles to go to work or go to the city on a daily basis, the leadership of the House put an end to that proposal.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most wanted is Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges to the state instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the East Seabird, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on 50 voluntary car drivers a short while ago, the drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor their every step.
"Alauddin Khan, who directed strategic and execution management in the Nevada Transport Department, says," "Anxiety about the Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem."
This is not what people wanted.
"As the test progressed, ACLU, Nevada, had warned on its website:" "It will be quite easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices."
There is no need to develop a vast, unrestricted technology framework that must be disseminated to keep a record of daily movement of each individual.
Nevada is one of the many states that are making all efforts to acquire affordable technology, with the help of which the states can get details of how many miles the car is running every day, but not where and when it is running.
"" "If you can do that, people can feel more comfortable."
The search for this technology took some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Miles.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax payers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance in which drivers were to pay on their mileage basis.
But the device it is testing was good for highway planners as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the model at a fixed time interval.
"" "If you don't track people's speed and their location, they will be more willing to adopt this method," "said Ryan Morrison, Chief Executive, True Miles."
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programmes of the State.
There are also very low cost and less intervention methods to do so.
In Oregon, planners are using different options to give drivers.
They can choose a GPS enabled or without a GPS device.
Or you may choose not to take any device again, but choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles to be decided by the residents of the state.
Other locations hope that this determination can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more facilities than less on the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also have the facility to pay parking meter charges, provide payment according to their drive insurance, and create a real time speed data collection from other drivers that will be used by motor-drivers to avoid traffic.
"The city planning document states," "Motorists will be attracted to participate due to the benefits it brings."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps the whole discussion on mille-wise payment is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that the Congress can deal with the problem of insolvency highway trust fund very easily by increasing the gas tax.
Overtime or annual charges may also be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars whose vehicles do not use much gas so that they pay their due share.
"" "When aspirin can work, what is the need for amulchul surgery," "said Randy Rentsheller, Director of Law and Public Affairs, the Commission."
If we do so, crores of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
According to police, he died due to suffocation.
However, his friend has been taken into custody by the police for concealing the belongings of the deceased.
The police has submitted the final report of the death in the court.
On August 26, police had recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Darya.
His family members had accused his friends of killing him as his mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
Police said the phone and SIM of the deceased were checked and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
During interrogation, the woman revealed that the phone was given to her by one of her relatives, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in the Pathshahi Bagh and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhail had gone to Jhelum with Zahid after offering namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all the goods on the shore, while Ruhail moved on the other side to smoke cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhail searched for Zahid but could not find him.
He picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept them for his use.
He did not tell anyone that Zahid was drowned.
Police told the court that Zahid died of drowning and the postmortem report has also been confirmed.
However, Ruhail has been detained under Section 404 for concealing facts and material of the deceased.

MRF awarded JD Power Award for 10th time in a row
Chandigarh: Indias largest tyre manufacturer and one of the top 15 global tyre companies, MRF has been awarded the JD Power Award for the 10th time in a row.
The award is widely regarded as equivalent to Oscar by colleagues in the automotive sector and holds the highest recognition in the industry.
Very few companies have received this award continuously for so many years.

Silvio Berlusconi, 77, former Prime Minister of Italy, has married a 28-year-old girl in a clandestine manner.
This was disclosed by his family friend Marthal Polanko.
According to him, Berlusconi, a three-time Prime Minister, has married former TV anchor Francisca Pascal in her private chapel.
Francisco met Balusconi when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia Party.
It was there that Francisca, whose relationship was said to be a mere pretence to have a relationship with Balrusconi.
Marthal Polanco, a close friend of Berlusconi and a Banga-Bunga girl, has revealed that she too was invited to the intelligence wedding.
The event took place three weeks ago.
When asked what would happen if the two get married, Polanko said that they are already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place in a private chapel located in the residence of the former Prime Minister.
Nobody can say anything more.
However, she did not marry him.
He has sent his greetings to the newly married couple.
The couple got married on October 8 or 9, about three weeks ago.
She was married to Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman 50 years old, about eight months ago.
To avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi had made loneliness the basis behind his decision.
Even in the lower areas, intermittent rain continued between the eyes of the sun.
With this, cold wave has started in the entire valley.
The minimum temperature in Srinagar was recorded at 4.8 degrees Celsius, Gulmarg minus 0.2 degrees Celsius and Leh minus 1.8 degrees Celsius.
Leh was the coldest place in the state.
The Jammu-Srinagar National Highway has been closed due to heavy snowfall in the state.
Heavy snowfall has occurred at Zojila pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of the season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activation of the Western Disturbance, snowfall in the higher reaches of the valley and rain in the lower reaches started in the early hours of Thursday, which continued till late evening.
Normal life was also affected due to the cold.
People were sleeping in their homes to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply was also disrupted in many areas.
Srinagar recorded a maximum temperature of 13.7 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal.
Jammu also received heavy rains in the early hours of Thursday, raising the cold at night.
Jammu recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the impact of Western Disturbance is beginning to decline and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Srinagar-based Meteorological Department Director Sonam Lotus, the weather in the valley is likely to remain dry from November 1 to November 7.
Asaram, who is lodged in a jail in connection with a sexual assault case, was on Friday again disappointed with the Supreme Court.
Asarams plea for a ban on media coverage was being presented as a blood dracula for children, but the court rejected his plea to block media coverage.
A bench headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop the news about Asaram, saying he had seen every word reported in the media and had no reason to interfere with it.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and others?
Earlier, Asarams lawyer had accused the media of exaggerating the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
Who should they file the case against, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they had more options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asarams plea to stay media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest theft of TDS so far.
The group operator of the mall cut TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions but did not pay it to the government exchequer.
By doing so, he kept depositing the TDS money with himself.
The group was picked up by the investigation team from Mumbai on October 17 in collaboration with the Jaipur Investigation Team.
Investigations revealed that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team had initiated the Income Tax Survey proceedings against the group on Thursday.
The group of the mall operator was raided and surveyed about 15 days ago.
Angry over the move, the trader has made it clear to the Income Tax Department officials that he is not ready to pay TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them.
Officials investigating the matter have clarified that in case of non-payment, action will be taken by sealing the account.
With Diwali, the demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of substandard and fake mats increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colourful and sweet, which is harmful to health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a drive against fake mawa and chemist sweets.
The department seized Rs 70,000 mawa and Rs 5,000 spoon from Quetta Colony from Madhya Pradesh.
With the demand for sweets increased in the market, the demand for substandard flour from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department was informed that the poor mother kept in the garbage was brought to Nagpur from Madhya Pradesh.
A consignment of mangoes is being imported from Transport Garage to Nagpur.
The police have seized the bag, which is worth Rs 70,000.
Fear of action did not entice anyone.
The Department destroyed it as an unclaimed property.
The department raided Jeetendra Catters in Quetta Colony and recovered about Rs 5,000 spoon.
Sodium hydrosulfate was used to shine the spoon and sustain for a longer period of time.
The samples have been sent to lab for testing.
Joint Commissioner of Police S S Deshmukh said that the drive to arrest chemist sweets and substandard and fake mice will continue.
The drive has been further intensified in the next few days.
Consuming these sweets can also be toxic.
The department asked the sweet traders to make good milk, flour and sweets.
The department has appealed to the people to beware of fake sweets and mangoes.
He was received at the airport by 42 senior BJP leaders.
Modi is on a visit to Bihar for the consolation tour organised by the BJP.
The consolation yatra is being organised by the BJP to pay homage to the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
A total of seven blasts took place one after the other during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in Patna on October 27.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally so that more and more people were killed and an atmosphere of fear was created in the state.
The terrorists did not succeed in their intentions, but six people were killed in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
Party leaders have been on a tour from his village with ashes and kalash.
On 5th November, their ashes will be immersed simultaneously in Ganga in Patna.
As part of this visit, a consolation yatra is being organized.
The film stars Narendra Modi in the lead role.
He will visit the village of those killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday and meet their families.
During the meeting, they will also provide a cheque of Rs. 5 each to the families of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced this assistance.
Buoyed by the thrilling win in the last match, India will look to continue their winning streak when they take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two successive ODIs were washed out due to rain, India had to win the Nagpur ODI to stay alive in the series and their batsmen put up a record win to level the series 2-2.
India have achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again it will be the responsibility of the batsmen to cross the Naya.
Indian batting is at its peak and the biggest target is also proving to be a dwarf before him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form but the team will also have high expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got an opening pair which is making the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a fantastic opening partnership to give Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
Virat Kohli is the third highest run scorer in the Indian Premier League.
But many cricket pundits have rated him better than Sachin Tendulkar.
Virat Kohli, who is set to become 25 years old next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, of which India have won 16.
Chasing the target, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as a great finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in great form but excessive dependence on these three can also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj had failed miserably in their last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open his account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, Bangalore can do a good innings in ODIs as a lifeline for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, their batsmen, especially skipper George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
They are also demanding that they be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to the ninth position.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have also batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to make any impact in the opening round.
Mitchell Johnson's lack of bowling could be a big blow for Australia.
Johnson, who has done well in the series so far, has been sent back home to prepare for the Ashes series.
Dr Jitendra Singh, Member and Chief Spokesperson, BJP National Executive, said that Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltration of terrorists under the guise of this hypocritical peace.
Citing intelligence agencies reports, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan was pushing for infiltration of around 2000 terrorists ready in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has intensified after the separatists' intentions to foment trouble in Kashmir have failed.
Referring to the visit of separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lt Gen Zahir ul Islam, LeT, Hizb leaders Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be fuelled in 2014.
Pakistan is working hard to fulfil this promise.
The killings of soldiers along the border, suicide attacks in Samba and Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for abolition of Army privileges in the state as murderous in such a situation, the BJP leader said it was also anti-people to say such things till there was lasting peace in the state.
They inspire anti-national elements.
He emphasized that statements that demoralised the army of leaders and security forces should be stopped.
Snowden ready to cooperate with Germany on US vigilance
Edward Snow Dane, an American intelligence informer, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to prove to Parliament in Germany if the US National Security Agency and its Director, Keith Alexander, fails to respond to their activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Bale met in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum to talk about testimony in Germany.
"The MP said in a letter presented by Mr. Snow Dane to the media in Berlin on Friday," "Although the results of my efforts are proven positive, my government believes in disagreement as a defection, and does not provide any defense that attempts to criminalise political speech with allegations of hooliganism." ""
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dane said he believes that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The allegations filed by the US Department of Justice include thefts from intelligence and government property.
"Hans Peter Frederick, German Interior Minister, told the online Zeit:" "Mr. Snow Dan has been willing to talk to German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA has claimed to have tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Aperman, Member of Parliament, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, looks after intelligence, saying that even if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snow Dane as a witness, without completely destroying relations with the United States and putting them at risk, it should be taken.
Mr. Bale, a Green Party MP from Germany, published a photograph of himself with Mr. Snow Dane on Twitter Feed.
He said he was on his visit to Russia with two German journalists.
According to the former NSA contractor lawyer, Snowden is not able to go back to Russia if he leaves Russia.
"If Snow Den testifies in Germany, he will be" "safe" "there that assurances will be needed, the MP said."
"In his letter, Mr. Snow Dane said that he had to face a" "terrible and sustained campaign" "that forced him to leave home."
"However, he said the world is happy and overwhelmed by the widespread reactions" "to its work of political expression." ""
World citizens, including the United States, as well as higher authorities, have estimated the revelation of an irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
"The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities" "when problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved." ""
Frontier Airlines to charge carriage on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to store cargo on its board for passengers.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a cary-on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday revealed that passengers can keep the entire coach.
The new cary-on-duty is for the bag in the overhead bin, so, small bags under the seat will still be charged free of cost.
Frontier said $25 will be charged if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay as long as they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said $100 was to be paid to take care of the charges in passenger advance.
"We don't want to charge that," "he said."
In 2008, the airlines started charging for the first and second test bags.
Passengers who are trying to avoid fees are filling as much as they can in the cary-on baggage that is stash in the overhead coach means there is often less space in this coach.
There is a way to bring down the fare for passengers on the board.
O'Malley said that this new charge is not really about raising money.
This is for the most loyal customers about Frontier that it has become increasingly difficult to find a place in the overhead bin.
Passengers do not have to pay this on the airlines website.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for the same bag, while a passenger in the line at a Frontier Gate can get a bag free of cost.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in processes are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fee before getting the gate.
Frantiers new cary-on-fee will not start until summer, though a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but airlines like them.
They argue that money is spent on handling the baggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
The baggage fee on Wall Street is seen by many as an indication that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, have not even paid cary-on-bag charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started a care-on fee for the first time three years ago, and fellow discount Allegant Air later.
Along with one such fee, the other airline in Hungary is Wizz Air, which is said by airline consultant J Sorensen, and which tracks add-on fees.
He said Spirit's cary-on-duty brings $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
A former officer of Sorensen, Midwest Airlines, recently flew to Spirit and expressed surprise that passengers had to face cary-on-unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was easy," "he said."
I was hoping to grind my teeth and see out at a fight gate.
The plane was full and he said it boarded the licet-split.
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire box, and give it free coffee only once.
Still, the water gets wasted.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but withdrew seven months later after passengers complained and followed any other major airline after being there.
This Frantier's move to charge customers directly from the airline is his latest attempt to operate to its own website if Frentiers do not buy it directly from the airline.
Airlines pays online travel vendor Orbitz for each of these $10 to $25 sold tickets.
That is why all the airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has moved forward in this area.
In September, many flights often started half a mile away for customers who had purchased from these individuals from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will achieve a distance of 250 miles.
It is also that they allow only passengers to choose their seats in advance on direct purchase from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base for customers in the city of his home in Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
Revenue declined 9 per cent and its flying capacity declined by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc on Wednesday.
They are trying to finance Frontier as part of the sale of Republic Airlines.
NSA accuses internal error instead of hackers for website crash
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical glitches and not because of hackers as some had claimed online.
"In an email statement, the intelligence agency said," "NSA .gov.in was not in touch for several hours tonight due to internal error during the pre-determined update."
This problem will be solved this evening.
The claim is not true that this constraint came due to the distributed denial of service [DOS] attack.
In the evening, online server trekkers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still not available.
"An NSA spokesperson told ABC News that there was no" "agreement" "with the agency's internal, sensitive network."
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the NSA website by the DDOS attack.
The DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such large quantities till the site is closed due to overload of the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively crude and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
"The former highly mysterious NSA, once called" "no such agency," "has become a topic of discussion and bitter criticism among the general public in the wake of the incidents of a large number of foreign and domestic espionage programmes in the past months which were collectively disbanded by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden after the theft of hidden NSA files from the agency and the mysterious discovery."
Due to such a growing controversy about the agency, after tonight's incident, there was speculation that the incident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
A beautiful expression was presented in line with the theme 'Another Dronacharya' in harmony with the Dvapara Yuga and the circumstances of today.
It was shown in the context of which bands a Guru is bound and forced to walk on the wrong path.
The play was jointly inaugurated by Prabhudyal Valmiki, MLA, St Joseph Inter College, Shipra Rastogi, Vice President, Cantonment Council, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh.
The play depicted the similarity of the circumstances of Dronacharya of the Dvapara era and Arvind, currently a professor.
Directed by Anil Sharma, the play starred Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bachan, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vamshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Ghazala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun and others.
The lighting of the play was done by young theatre personality Jitendra C Raj and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
Later, various awards were presented to the winners of literary and cultural performances on the occasion.
Dr Aslam Jamsetpuri, President, Department of Urdu, Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and theatre personality Jitendra C Raj were also present on the occasion.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi and others were present on the occasion.
Bombardier's profit declines as delivery of aircraft
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15 per cent decline in net profit, in the third quarter of its train unit and in the form of pressure by aircraft orders and deliveries less than that on contract issues.
Montreal based Bombardier also did not come up with an update on issues on whether any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft will be released or the aircraft will complete its ambitious program of going to commercial service from September next.
About another half a month before the first flight of the test aircraft, it has been flown only three times, the question is whether the test phase is on the track or not.
The result fell below the forecast and the stock has been sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8 per cent sliding.
"" "Cameroon Dorsen, an analyst with the National Bank Financial, downgraded its rating for" "" field performance "" "from" "" loss "" "on Thursday." ""
"Weak aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are obviously disappointed with margin performance in transport," "Dorsen said in a client note."
We will get a new order for Bombardier Cseries as a progress of flight testing programme.
However, if no new orders are being announced in the coming months, the market is suspected to be apprehensive of the event.
Bombardier hopes that the airline families can now cut it at a lower end of the Boeing and Airbus dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Potential buyers wait for the flight test results to validate the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as the pucca orders for Cseries are in the middle of 177.
403 complete orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bodine was confident that Bombardier would meet his 300 firm order target from the time he first brought the jet into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was going on as per the schedule.
"The test aircraft was staying on the ground for a longer time than expected," "Bodine said in a conference call, adding that the land test and software update were also scheduled during the aircraft interval."
Every manufacturer makes a schedule in a different way.
We have decided to take a first flight and do an update period and said what we have done.

The new research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
I dont think of lying or cheating anyone.
But in the evening, our minds change and we keep the ideal aside and move against the rule.
The study, conducted by David Escalus School of Business at Harvard University and the University of Utah, has revealed several interesting facts.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values in the morning without work stress, but by evening we lose honesty due to fatigue or high pressure.
The researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the point is more on the left or on the right.
Participants were told that if they give a wrong answer instead of the right answer, they will be given money.
The experiment showed that the people who were used between 8 am and 12 am made no mistake and gave the right answer.
While experimenting between 12 pm and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in check.
This enabled the researchers to prove that greed for money in the morning does not matter to our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
The study was published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.

Koken's habitual lawyer jailed for giving secret information about police investigation to Shri Big
Basharat Ditta, 42, used to inform the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer felt that people could know about his secret drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
The top defence lawyer, who told Mr Big about the main police investigation, as he feared that people would know about his secret drug addiction, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Barasht Ditta, 42, after compromising his cocaine addiction, used to provide sensitive confidential information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough about his drug trafficking investigations.
"The lawyer, nicknamed" "Bash," "and who was praised as a" "top briefcase" "by criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he had represented in the previous Narcotics trial."
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarborough holding three cocaine bags at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
"After the detection of cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, her wallet, and her credit card, it was found that Ditta was a" "regular user" "of A category of drugs."
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All the four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation into the heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other persons who were sent to jail after police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash during several raids.
Ditta, 42, used to provide information to the criminals as she feared that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who works at Blackbanded law firm Forbes Solicitors, was today facing failure in the Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty in two cases of obstructing the path of justice after a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted to keeping cocaine in the previous hearing.
The lawyer's bad time started when while examining Scarborough, the police found out that he was in regular contact with Ditta over the phone since February 2011.
Two spies chased the suspect and found him coming to Ditta's house and carrying drugs with more than 60 per cent purity under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
After the drug was kept, Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta over the phone, who had gone out for dinner at Blackern Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that the drug was kept there and there was a nine conversation between them.
"The court was hearing that on detection of Category A drug on Ditta's hair, wallet and credit cards, he was found to be a" "regular user" "of cocaine in the test."
"Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer as he was his client and said his discussion was a" "matter of legal privilege." ""
During his arrest, Ditta took out his wallet and tried to remove many credit cards, but they were seized, and his hair samples were taken.
In a police interview, he said that he used to run an office from his workplace as well as his home, and his clients used to call him to his house for legal matters.
After the main persons arrested told what the detectives knew about them, the court said in the hearing that Ditta used to call the heads of the drug supply chain, some of which he had earlier submitted the case.
"On behalf of the prosecution, Anne White said:" "The criminal lawyer should be best aware of not breaking the law."
Shri Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal lawyer, having a lot of association with his distinguished client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a normal drug dealer but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without any doubt as he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limits of the court-client relationship.
He obstructed police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Shri Ditta was not honouring his profession but insulting him.
He made too many closures from certain clients, especially from Scarborough, and allowed him to compromise with his independence.
"Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed:" "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately." ""
"But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Helsted said:" "At the same time that Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, he converted himself from criminal lawyer to criminal lawyer."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he made a lot of compromise and became very weak towards the objectives of leading members of organized crime groups who used it to get important information related to police investigation.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Shri Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to escape in the guise of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire investigated Mr. Ditta, who was also found guilty of three incidents of cocaine possession and now obstructing the path of justice, reflecting our commitment to bring the perpetrators to court.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On her website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself in which she said that she would have a fantasy job to become a lawyer for a death row client in the US, a dinner guest for Mohammad Ali and an inspiration for her work.
Kenya press outraged over controversial media law
"Challenging the Bill as unconstitutional, the newspaper said," "This is a terrible place, and it is legal to ask: What is there to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary in the coming tomorrow?" ""
"" "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it," "said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM."
He said that the new Media Tribunal will always be biased as it is part of the Government and that banning content and advertisement will harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"" "I hope the President listens to us, and we appeal to them to reject the Bill and send it back to the MPs," "he said."
"The new bill will provide" "strict control of the media" "to the government, while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya were" "dealt a severe blow" "and termed the bill as cruel, The Star newspaper reported."
The Bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after the attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of troops sent to the site of the attack, showing them looting the mall, which angered the Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo had summoned two journalists and media persons for questioning, though the summons was withdrawn after the media created ruckus.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined 2 crore Kenyan shillings and 10 lakh Kenyan shillings to different journalists and in addition, the additional risk of removal from the list or non-official press recognition will be different.
The Tribunal also has the power to confiscate the property of the offender in case of non-payment of penalty.
"According to Daily Nation," "only one criterion is sufficient to shake the foundation of most of the FM stations."
"It also said that these measures could have devastating effects on what is described as Kenya's" "vibrant blogosphere." ""
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do their own thing.
"National journalist Mutuma Mathew describes Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life and writes," "No one will ever know."
"" "If left to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and take us back to an era of hunting and hoarding."
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced public anger.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejecting deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored tax-free pay for about 532,000 shillings per month, which is considered one of the highest in the world.
New Delhi | Jagran Entertainment Desk: Mukesh Ambani's wife Nita Ambani is celebrating her first birthday on November 1.
Earlier, the atmosphere of celebration was completely created by the performance of AR Rahmans team.
Rahman performed his signature songs at the musical night which started at 8 pm.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage to showcase the beautiful colours of dance.
About 32 charters reached Jodhpur to attend Nita Ambani's birthday celebrations.
The charter was parked at Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur due to lack of parking space at Jodhpur airport.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars, including BMW and Jaguar, were imported
Sood said the sanitation and street lights in the city have completely failed.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre of Panchkula.
They have demanded a complete rollback of the house tax from Panchkula.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Sood said after the municipal elections, the city has got new councillors and mayors but they do not have the power to get work done.
As a result, the city corporators have become a dummy and the authorities are working on their own.
Sood said the Municipal Corporation has crores of rupees but all the money is being collected by depositing it in the form of FDs in the banks.
But no steps are being taken to put money on the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of a dumping ground in Sector 23, people living in the areas across the Ghaggar have been forced to lead a normal life for the past several years.
Municipal authorities have been talking about shifting the dumping ground at Jhuriwala village for the past several years, but the people of Barwala area are already facing a serious problem of flies.
He said that the condition of health services and education system in the villages has deteriorated.
No work has been started till date to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
UN sets new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations is about to immediately start working on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
In order to replace the MDD ending in 2015, the Australian diplomat played an important role just before the Evening Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro to advance the Sustainable Development Goals.
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gilard during the Summit.
"UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that the time has come to" "rise above national interests." ""
I am very happy that the member countries have agreed to initiate and take over the process to establish a universal sustainable development goal.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and will be an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will do everything possible to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to achieve our far-reaching objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of MDG.
Mozambican security concerns grow into conflict with powerful personalities
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo with a statue of the founder President of Mozambique, Samora, who was staring down at him, to raise slogans of peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," "said Vanessa de Susa, CEO of an investment company."
"Fearful about the future of her country, she changed her corporate dress from a printed T-shirt" "We demand security" "in Ekpurthagali and joined a crowd of capital Independence Square on Thursday."
The conflict between government forces and Ray NaMo for two weeks has been reported almost daily, since more than 20 years before a peace deal.
Ray NaMo was once a notorious rebel of the movement supported by the white - ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid government of South Africa as part of initially efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Accord, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a fully developed conflict, but recent events have enthused foreign investors and local people.
Some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Vale, Eni, Brazil, to explore the vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves in the northwest, could invest more than $50bn next year.
The ruling Freelimo Party, the major political power since 1975, and Ray NaMo have blamed each other for tensions.
Ray Namo says the government started the latest struggle on October 17 by attacking its members in Sofa La Province, a traditional Re Namo Garh
As the attacks and repercussions on the former rebels escalated, the government forces attacked the Renmo targets and tried to kill the spokesman for Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group leader, Fernando Mazhang, Ray Namo, Financial Times reported.
The government blames Ray NaMo for the trigger of the conflict, accusing the soldiers of attacking.
President Armando Jeevante has called for an end to concerns about instability.
"Mr Jeettane told AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhakama had seen himself as a" "loser" "and that his forces continue to try to prove that they can implement their own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray NaMo insist that they want to avoid war.
Shri Majhang was quoted as saying that the 1992 Peace Accord was annulled by Ray Namo but later became a matter of concern.
He told FT means that it is not being honoured by the agreement free Limo
"Our vision is to come back for the agreement talks, but seriously," "said Mr. Mazhangne."
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to ease the centuries-old tensions in a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about two big men (Jeetann and Dhakama) fighting together," "said Yusuf Han, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambique expert."
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are necessary to create types of concessions.
Ray NaMo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said about a boycott of the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt by the government to win concessions and economic plunder.
The share of Ray NaMo in voting has been declining since 1992, while a new party, a former Ray NaMo member, is expected to improve its performance in the elections, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM).
Mr. Majhang says - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want to leave the presidency because he does not want peace, he does not want transparent elections," "Majhang said."
It is not clear what kind of capacity Ray NaMo has had, but he has made disruptive hit and run visits to police stations and vehicles on a major North South Highway.
Most of the clashes are in Sofa La Province, several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, with the host Bera Port, which relies on exporting mining, coal, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
In June, after threatening to attack the Ray NaMo line, the Railways suspended its experiment for about a week.
Ray Namo was almost asked if he would be able to repeat the threat.
"" "Things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community," "said Mr. Mazang."
The government of instability has exacerbated frustration, says Fernando Lima, Media Cop, who heads an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and the recent floods of kidnappings.
People have the government and the president to those responsible for the future of the country, and they seem to be one to find a solution to the problems, he says.
Omar Sultanate, an exhibitor, still needs stability.
"No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," "he said."
"Children should be taught myths and legends" "as models for a way of writing life." ""
"Thor 's stories could show that" "there is no competition of all subtle tactics in cruel power," "while Arthurian legends show the importance of having a dream."
"Many of the myths would also" "not be appropriate to be taught in wild even far away and in some cases obscene and in schools," "advocated Cross Lee Holland as one of the appropriate tasks of age."
"I find it surprising, in the United States, myths and folk songs are already a part of the field of education," "he said."
I am supporting it as a plan for twenty years.
"He has called writers and teachers" "more enlightened" "and this is a" "new turn" "for children, as well as messages are being presented in entertaining stories."
"Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as wrote the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folklore, said:" "You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
Perhaps for a child, a big difference between an adult writer writing and an adult writer writing is the need for some meaning of hope.
Everything has to come for a simplified or a happy end, because it is a spontaneous feeling of good and bad.
And that should be submitted, but rather it was said to have been revealed through a story.
Not showing the old basis.
Communication Associate, Ghumarwin: Head Constable Om Prakash retired after serving in the Police Department in Ghumarwin for 32 years.
A farewell party was organised by the police department staff and officials on the occasion.
Om Prakash is a resident of Bhapral village in Bani Bhaparal Gram Panchayat.

Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that the city of New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in the United States: About a hundred years ago comedian Frank Fey, who worked as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, started telling people sitting in the crowd directly in a way of conversation.
Fe's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Built and operated by Caroline Hirsh, the founder of the Stand-up Institute called Carolines, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included over 60 shows in small clubs and big theatres.
"" "Most of these headliners appeared in Carolines, and became a huge success, to a level where they became too big to play in the club," "says Hersh."
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This years event includes the presence of Wanda Cykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at the Madison Square Garden, Stand Up for Heroes, which included Bruce Springsteen, John Stuart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded.
Many comedians participating in this years festival have come through non-traditional means, such as short networks such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll moved from Deep-Cable Citcom (FXX's Joyfully Ronchi Fantacy-Football Theme The League) to prominence, and is now his own comedy central sketch show.
"Jenny Slate has been a cast member of" "Saturday Night Live" "and" "Parks and Recreation," "although she is best known for her vocal video series" "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On." ""
Other young comedians with different voices, including crawls and slates (Anthony Jeselnik with a completely different noisy, satirical, caste-centric W. Camau Bell) are products of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David:
Steinberg started working as a stand-up comedian, but has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, she hosted a show on TV Land called Set Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at Town Hall, in the heart of Manhattan.
"" "The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry's works."
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he goes to the street between two buildings and used to think in himself that if I had lost my entire money, I would be here.
Oil continues to decline to $96 per barrel
A report on higher supplies such as Friday, where oil prices continue to decline, is offsets where the power hungry manufacturing sector in China is strengthening.
Benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 per barrel in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange late in the morning.
The contract fell 5.8 per cent for the month of October, 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has been weighed in recent weeks.
The US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week, the Department of Energy said on Wednesday
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 2.5 million barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand increased activity has revealed that two reports on sugar manufacturing have come on Friday.
It is only evident that growth can continue to strengthen Chinas economic recovery after a gap of 7.8 per cent in the last quarter of the third quarter over a decade or two.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil used by US refineries, fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
The Court has restrained the New York Police Department from taking action on the ceasefire and sports policy
On Thursday, a federal appeals court blocked the changes that require a judge's order for the New York Police Department's break and sporting event and removed the judge from the case.
Judge Shira Schindler of the US Circuit Court of Appeals 2 & has said that the judge's verdict will be delayed on the outcome of an appeal by the city.
In August, the judge had ruled in violation of the Constitution in a manner that prevented people from being detained in the city and excluded from its schedule of questioning.
The city police department has also decided to allocate a monitoring to help change its policy and the training programme associated with it, its findings and remedial orders have been appealed.
The appeal court heard the arguments on the request on Tuesday.
The appellate court has said that since it entered into a need agreement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media interviews and has done wrong to US judges contrary to the code of conduct by the public, the judge's case should be removed, the court of statements should be publicly accountable for criticizing it.
The judge ruled that the police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its stoppage and sporting programme.
It has appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and it is the most closed where some have ordered a pilot program to test body wear cameras in the campus.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of storing names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police ban.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after 14th March, 2014.
Cancellation and sports devices have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and sports policy has somehow been around decades, but most black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to 2011, dramatically inhibited growth under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to raise a time.
One case was filed by four men and all minorities in 2004 and became a class action case.
Proponents of the NYPD's break and change in sports programme have said that unfair behaviour will end, a more credible and effective police force has to be deployed and other police departments can influence the use of policies.
Opponents say the changes will reduce the morale of the police, but crime, money loss and not a comprehensive problem of a police force under pressure from thousands of officers during the last decade will be resolved.
The judge noted that there was no end to the break and sports, which is constitutional, but improved the implementation of the stop of NYPD.
Participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training in large numbers.
During the seven days period, all the participants were informed about various disciplines including tent pitching, flag pole etc.
The responsibility of training is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
By joining the Sarva Dharma prayer, all the participants are spreading the spirit of unity.
Camp president Vipin Kumar is providing his special support to the State Training Commissioner.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
"Andy Colson, former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using" "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" "in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clark's love affair when he was the Home Secretary."
Prosecutor Andrew Aedes QC told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his attractive special advisor Hannah Polby.
"The court said the newspaper appointed private investigator Glenn Mulkeyer to hack Polby's voicemail and" "monitor" "the male, but Colson also called and left his violin."
Mr. Aedes said that the prosecution suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the homes of people and keep an eye on them, but he keeps articles before people to see how people react to it.
He said that NOTW used three ways to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third one included the editors himself.
Apparently, he knew other ways, that is, the nigger, he certainly knew.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
"He says," "No, we say, yes, he knew exactly." ""
"The rumor about Clark's love affair was first presented by the AOTW feature desk when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said:" "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
From home in MulCare in August 2006, the tapes of voicemail were seized at least three times from Ms. Polby's phone.
The investigators also found entries in the computer of the private investigator on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named Project.
During the period during which she was being examined, she was called by her grandparents to seek information about her.
Former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup monitored the movement of Ms. Polby.
"On June 18, 2005, through a voice, Colson told him:" "I have found a story that we are planning to run tomorrow, which I would certainly like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Aedes said that Colson's involvement in the case is in Parton, with other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blancet.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had spoken to Mr. Blonket about a romantic relationship with a married woman, while he was looking at the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Colson and Brooks refused to compromise with others to hack the phone between October 3, 200. and August 9, 2006.
MulCare, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.
Disclosures by NSA on State Surveillance Promote Corporate Fear.
Late in August on a quiet day, a German police helicopter landed at the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the directions of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the mission of Germany's domestic intelligence agency was to take a photograph of the roof of the US post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
The German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of Lisning Antenna and indicated an exchange action between the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence of the United States, stressed that the United States should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities in September to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and enhance or enhance their international competitiveness.
But since Edward Snowden began to reveal the treasure of the secrets of a contractor who has become a whistleblower to US surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director does not keep his promise.
The US National Security Agency carried out espionage on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came to light when it was found that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was buggy, possibly a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, surely business leaders are also setting potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it will be viable to use these data for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," "says Oliver Grn, President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies."
According to a survey published by the German companies consultancy in July, the US has become almost a big risk like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
All documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, no evidence so far that the United States has come to know the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of EU internet capabilities and should strive to reduce their dependence on the US.
Trade leaders are doubting this.
Someone in the German Parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"" "This is not the way," "said Hauso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP."
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he would not have been allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about US technical refining and espionage access have proved to be a blow to some companies that previously believed that the biggest surveillance threat was China
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing hole where European officials are more aware that the data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and hence has become potential sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, a business entity, some 10 per cent of non-American members cancelled a plan to use an American based cloud provider after disclosing about the data prism mining program.
"Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP, says:" "We saw a new question that did not come to customers a year ago - is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will be physically within that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and data and therefore should guard them at all costs.
That economic espionage is not surprising.
This has always happened.
"It has been a subject for many years, and through fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed," "says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF."
The United States spies on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do, because it is in national interest to protect our business
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defence system and are an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, messages have been being recorded for a long time even if it is unwise to leave one in the business from home with usb stick, or leaving a laptop shelter in a hotel room is unwise to say at least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of car manufacturer Audi, says, This is a year-long old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices
The German BFV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile while smart phones are entering into agreements on foreign visits due to risk.
The pre-paid mobile phones were later discarded.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring, which is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it is number one in the global market in many companies.
"Small and medium size companies often warn of lack of experience, effective protection of corporate secrets against unauthorized access to personnel and financial resources," "BfV warned in a report."
The US has warned of economic espionage by its own companies by other countries.
According to the France The Washington Post, US national intelligence in February was named after Russia and Israel in another Tier of criminals involved in hacking for the economic intelligence behind China, which is behind China.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, French is the worst
Bernard Scorcini, a former head of French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: Services are well aware that even if all the countries join hands in a non-terrorist fight, they spy on their allies.
Nobody became a fool.
The parents of a Georgian teenager who was killed in a unique accident believe that his son was killed
A Georgian teenager whose body was found wrapped in a restling mat in his high school gym is believed to have been killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
On January 11, Candric Johnson of Valdosta, G.A. was found trapped in a straight standing mat behind the blisters inside his high school gym.
Investigators in Landes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died in a unique accident, but the 17-year-old boy's family refused.
"Advocate Benjamin Kramp, appearing for Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that" "he fully believes that his son has been killed." ""
They do not believe in the death in the manner described by Sheriff.
"" "I believe this is beyond the logic of physical law and general intelligence," "Kramp said."
He feels that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of his son.
"" "He had sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag"
US Attorney General Michael Mulray on Thursday said he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, given that many important questions were unanswered.
What caused the deaths?
Was he murdered for some crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
"" "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation."
"Moore told the reporter that preliminary autopsy indicated that Johnson's death was a result of" "static obstruction." ""
According to Moore, however, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death.
There are many questions which need to be answered or confirmed.
Moore also said that he would ask the FBI to do so if he found enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in Johnson's death.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of Landes County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boys parents say they hope to get some clues from the video footage about how he died.
CDC issues Allergy Guidelines for Children for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control the food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government as the number of school going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in every 20 children in the US has food allergies.
The CDC observed that there has been an increase of 18% in food allergies in children between 1997 and 2007.
In this direction, schools have been informed about how to inform teachers and staff about food allergies in children, and how to deal with any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been advised to keep a stock of epinephrine which is the auto-injector of the APPen brand which is most commonly used to face potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
The State Legislative Assembly has recently updated the rules so that schools can easily store more amount of epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children with allergic reactions.
"Children might say" "It seems something is kissing in my tongue," "It seems my tongue has hair," "or" "my tongue is swinging." ""
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose Sex Unprescribed for Their Children
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize the third gender for children born with vague genitals.
Newborn children will no longer be traditionally referred to as males or females.
"According to the new law, parents are not required to declare sex for such children, the law allows them to declare gender" "undetermined" "or" "unspecified" "on the birth certificate of the child."
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can take decisions regarding gender-specification surgery for newborns in a hurry, and combat discrimination against intersex children.
"According to the BBC, an intersex man had said years later," "Neither am I a man nor a woman."
I will continue to remain an injured, stained pen made by the doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which fall under investigation of sexual development disorders, is a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or testicles), or abnormal developed sex.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify the gender when there can be no sex determination and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before conducting surgery, if such a situation arises.
"Dr. Jack Dresher, a New York City psychologist who specializes in sex identification, said Germany's new law" "appears to be a good thing." ""
Intersex children create moral confusion.
"" "Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but most children do not."
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give an appropriate answer as to why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
The report filed before the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not related to gender but to its biological composition, which is neither clearly male nor female but either combined or is not clearly defined.
These features can show themselves secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length in reproductive organs such as primary sexual characteristics and genitals or chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report provides a overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as the crimes of harassment, violence and bias.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-compatible genders.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult individuals to identify male, female or third gender on their official documents.
"In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori May-Welby became the world's first recognized" "gender-less" "man after winning a legal appeal for lifelong" "unspecified" "gender status."
According to the Interior Ministry, the German passport will also have a third specification as X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial in neighbouring France.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition for withdrawal of gender theory from school books.
"The US website Catholic Online has also opposed Germany's law, saying," "While the world is going to a situation where gender is a self-chosen option, but not sexual activity, we are taking the other two pillars of civilization in the opposite direction." ""
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn also told the baby zone that she would love to see children specialize in sex at birth.
"" "The upbringing is very stressful without additional limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is," "he said on the website."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites (bisexual), in the name of the beautiful Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered gender to be slate which could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that gender identification is a complex task, and sometimes even doctors may make mistakes, who do not know what children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
"Dresher says," "In the middle of the 20th century, it was called the" "psychiatric emergency." ""
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with vague genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of the University of John Hopkins, who considered gender to be culinary.
"He coined the term" "gender identity" "and argued that social and environmental signals - parents - interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether to be identified as a man or as a woman."
But in a 1966 case, known as John / Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis had accidentally fallen into sex during circumcision to get the child completely bound and get her ovaries out and raise her like a girl.
"" "Money presented that case as a successful case of transfer, but it didn't happen," "Dresher said."
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
"Dresher said that some doctors are still" "following the same pattern." ""
But with the advent of the Internet in the 1990s, individuals undergoing these sex surgeries began to appear "" not happy with the result. "" "
Similar was the case with Montana's 36-year-old author Jim Bruce, who was born with the XY male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
"Doctors did not clearly understand that his penis was small, or his saffron was large, but they were certain that he could never live a" "satisfying life" "as a man."
Therefore, shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and ovaries were removed by surgery and raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"" "I knew I was not a girl."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, she was about to undergo vaginoplasty.
But depressed and feeling somewhat disturbed, he demanded medical records.
This revealed a stark truth.
I was bound at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man back, took the dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
He became barren due to surgery.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to normalise their perception.
"However, Anne Tamer-Mattis, executive director of the California based legal group Advocates for Information Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law" "invites chimpanzees and stigma." ""
"" "Many activists feel that German law will inspire parents to take quick decisions and refer to the child as" "unscheduled." ""
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, specifying male or female sex is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only speculate.
"Tamar-Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because" "it allows adults to be identified in the third gender." ""
"" "Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender."
The law of Germany deals with the specification of it at birth.
This is not a battle fought by newborns at this time.
As they grow older, they can take their own body decisions.
"But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorders, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law will" "empower both parents and children." ""
Baratji's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but had a DSD called full androgen insensitivity symptom.
Since she had defects in androgen graffiti, female characteristics developed in Katie.
There is vagina in his body but there is no uterus or ovary gland.
Katie, 29, is now married and is a resident of the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to adopt or become a mother through gestational surrogacy.
"" "This law allows parents not to take a hasty decision on their own," "Baratz said."
It gives them a proper understanding and time by some testing before writing 'male' or 'female'.
Thus, you stay healthy - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy it.
We do not need to do such surgery in a hurry that cannot be done back.
"" "It brings children into the decision making process and frees them from the anxiety that motivates parents as they do not believe they are doing well," "he said."
Finally, the child will decide which gender he is more comfortable with -- and it will be a very good thing.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
A legal awareness camp was organised by the Tehsil Legal Services Committee, Ramnagar, under the chairmanship of Committee Chairman and Sub Judge, Ramnagar, Sandeep Kaur.
Students and others were given the right to education and the law for economically backward people.
Advocate ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj and Sarpanch spoke on the subject and made the people aware.
A large number of villagers attended the function.
Report: Consideration of Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, advisors close to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton's replacement for the post of Vice President for 2012.
"The most notable eruption in the revelation is the highly anticipated 2012 campaign Tom," "Double Down: Changing the Game, 2012." ""
"The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and Thursday evening reported that top advisers to the President held" "comprehensive group sessions and late 2011 polling" "to find out what dumping Biden can help Obama in the falling hope of re-election."
According to Times National Political Reporter Jonathan Martin, the book provides full information about the efforts of the key officials and the former White House staff head bill for the name White House, to find out how the change of former state secretary Clinton from the Vice President affects the poll.
The possible switch was a very secure secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office.
The changes of former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, including only half a dozen close advisors to the president, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Palouffe were under consideration.
The double down claims that Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal coordination, when his information was finally telling him that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's condition.
In an interview with Martin, Dell confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I said keeping the entire scene in mind, and one of them, it was," "Dale told the newspaper."
"You remember, when the presidency was in danger at that time, we were in such a situation," "Holy Christ, what else will we do?"
"While Dale described the research as" "cautious," "Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made significant investments in finding out how much dividend this bet would pay if the poll was done."
"Campaigns do not spend like money on voting and focused groups as long as they are seriously considering something," "Martin said on AC360."
It is unclear, though, did Obama know that his team was looking for changes?
Martin told CNN he asked Dale if his boss was aware of the possible reshuffle.
"While Dale said he" "didn't think the President was aware of the possible change," "the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was" "possible" "that Obama knew it."
"The" "double down" "will certainly not answer if political investigations reached Obama's desk?"
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought about Obama Biden dumping ticket research.
"Probably," "said Martin."
Do you like glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the worlds first glo-in-the-dark ice cream jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the sea animal to develop the best breakfast.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and assured Chinese scientists used chemical brightness to re-shine the protein.
Ice cream will raise the pH level of protein by reacting with the eating tongue and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says the ice cream burns as it reacts with the heat of the mouth, that is, the more it will ignite, the more it will ignite.
"Charlie, founder of Lick Mi Am Delicius Ice Cream Company, said:" "This is an incredible thing but the initial days production will get about 2 grams of goods from m 200." ""
The protein that we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth heats up, the protein increases the pH level and the ice cream shines.
We have been testing for the last few months and it looks absolutely correct to share it on Halloween as it gives an amazing brightness effect
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream ever made because the jellyfish brightness is four times more expensive than gold
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
However, it tastes really good.
Charlie's Bristol experimental company, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaves, is famous for its unusual taste.
But his next creation is going to be even more ambitious.
"He said:" "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is natural impossible because of the ice crystals that replicate on the ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the use of a reflected quality of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire market was shut down in the Rani Bagh market.
Recently, people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
The same was the case at Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Central Market, Prashant Vihar.
A similar view was also seen at bullion shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
People also bought gold and silver jewellery here.
This led to traffic snarls in other markets, including the outer ring road.
However, people who had come out of the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, remain silent late and play up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I have become more than a greedy person
I did not even sign in to get candy out of my apartment for the last two years and maybe not this year.
But statistics show that I am a black sheep when Holovan comes
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating Halloween this time, spending $6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing I have always seen is the tendencies of Har. Halloween.
According to the NRF, the cost of costume is estimated at $1.2 billion out of the total cost of $6.9 billion
This year sexy is angry with inanimate things.
Women do not have to do prostitution because they also have sex food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots
I hope for the men a lot of zombies, and thanks to Murdo's growing space will create our Instagram feeds for the men.
According to Google, the most searched costumes will be zombies, Batman, Robbers and wrists.
I guess there is nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dogs and surprisingly we were not alone.
According to the NRF, the American people will actually spend $330 million on pet clothes.
This is the irony that a lot of hot dogs are with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen, the Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
The hairy bars, lollipop, milk dumps, twiglors and Clark bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the US Department of Commerce, it is good news that 41 million metric and trix are going to participate in our neighbourhood.
But in reality we, and what we're joking will buy during the 90 million pound chocolate helovin.
According to the Confessors Association, one thing we will not use candicorn during Halloween, but that will also sell about 35 million pounds.
That is the personal bundle of Mecca about 9 billion.
This is a secret. To solve so far
Nothing more than the philosophical Halloween ghost houses.
"They are the best name," "Terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison)," "Chikh-o-Chekh" "and were like" "House of shock." ""
According to American power in fact, there are 1200 officially approved ghost houses in the United States that produce 500 million revenue. And the terrible good pictures that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and comments on you.
Finally, let's talk about Qaddu.
Charlie Brown introduced the great Kadu when we were children, and a jak-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is something that we have done since we were small.
Luck for us, the Baby in a Pumpkin Trend started last year because of Pinterest, so most of us grew up by carving these guards and not selling with them.
According to the US Census Bureau, this year, the US will spend around $106 million on Qaddu.
The slowly fading lantern may be from Illinois at its front porch, which increased by 542 million pounds this year.
If you are looking for additional loans, in phone Tim and Susan Matildon Napa, Kalif., and above, try to carve them 2,032 pounds of pumpkin.

The dream of cracker traders to do business in the firecracker market in the transport area was not fulfilled.
The firecracker traders are stuck in the middle after the High Court order.
They can no longer do business in the makeshift firecracker market set up at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licences for business in the transport area.
The Commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue unsafe.
A fine of Rs 10 lakh was also imposed on the Amritsar Deputy Commissioner for not making proper arrangements there.
In its order, the High Court has reprimanded the Amritsar administration for doing something that could not solve even a single problem of firecracker traders for nine years.
They could not be provided proper space in the city.
Thereafter, due security arrangements were made and the firecracker traders were asked to issue licences for the business in the market located at Jahajgarh.
Though the firecracker traders were happy with the order, their happiness was thwarted by the police on Friday.
A team of police arms license branch reached the firecracker market and sold the farm at the counter.
It was impossible to fulfil the conditions given to them in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Aslaha Licence Branch in-charge Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the firecracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
Therefore, licences were not issued to crackers traders.
Diwali is just a day away.
Due to this, traders are incurring heavy losses.
A loss of lakhs of rupees has occurred.
Fireworks Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say they will claim the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Angry cracker traders took out a protest march from Jahajgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the district administration and the police.
Ranjit then closed his business in the makeshift firecracker market at Avenue.
A fire brigade was called in to rescue a lost puppy at the front of a critical mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spanil Ruby fled after a small road collision
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine
Fire brigade personnel pulled out the front portion of the rock from the rope to save the dog from death
After Papi somehow got trapped in the mouth of a critical mountain 50 feet above the ground, he got a fortunate life by calling the firefighters.
Nine - month - old Cocker Spanil Ruby ran away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being saved from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the flat mine in West Yorkshire to meet him again, Denham, Ruby, and he thanked the Western Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After his escape after a minor accident, he had discovered his lost dog like a lunatic, and posted an appeal on social networking sites.
At 2.15 pm on Wednesday, a fast watch dock walker saw Ruby on a mountain in the mine at an altitude of 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Clakheton Fire Station rushed to the spot and pulled down the Ruby with a rope to save him and used a stomach tube to bring him down the rock.
"" "Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said:" "" She was in a critical condition. "" "
She was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
He did not do a single act during the rescue, it was a stone.
But now he is good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was a call for a totally unusual help.
Rather, it is unbelievable to see the dog.
"Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said:" "Ruby is lucky to have survived."
He was likely to be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to an veterinarian for examination, where he was found to be good in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
"Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said:" "It was terrible to see the rescue operation"
At first I could not believe how she reached there.
It is amazing to have him back in their hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was very tired and fell, she would definitely have fallen down.
The fire brigade did a great job.
What they have done is really a very courageous job.
We are grateful to them, and they were all great.
"From Kigley, Mr. Alderson also said:" "We feared that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire brigade did an excellent job.
I cant believe how he reached there.
Mick Jagger says when Katy Perry was 18, he did not attack her
"In an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Pon Star said he had sung backing vocals for Zagar's 2004 song" "Old Habits Die Hard." ""
"Perry said he had dinner with the senior rocker, and" "he attacked me when I was 18." ""
"" "This is old, and he treats me well."
"The 70-year-old Zagar representative said in a statement on Thursday that he" "categorically denies attacking Katie Perry anytime." ""
"The representative also said:" "Perhaps Perry is speaking of another person in a misunderstanding"
Perry was one of the guests on Rolling Stone's Tour this year.
"His new album" "Prism" "peaked at number one this week."
George Kerevan: Euro dissolution gives Scotland the option
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join Europe as an independent travel zone as a condition for EU membership.
Passport control at Barwick and thorn wires on Hadrian walls indicate stories.
It is true that the Strathclide Paper described the potential economic benefits of independent movement with the rest of Europe, though not predicted - in headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as per their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen region, Brussels will actually have an affordable discount for sustainable non-compliance Brussels in return for achieving what they want from Scotland.
So, then, a story.
First of all, I had heard the baseless news about 40 years ago that freedom means passport control.
Yet, there was an interesting point in renarrating this interesting old story.
Why should we expect independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why should London's Yok be sold to Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organise Europe has finally come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe has officially died.
The dedicated parties are gaining strength throughout the EU to oppose the EU or to shut down the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurospatil Alternative for Germany Party - which was founded this year - suddenly received about five million votes in the federal election of September, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dams) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical one.
Along with the stringent rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, restrictions on the national economies through compliance of the same currency have forced many people to think that the project has gone too far to Europe.
The euro crisis did not play much role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the exchange rate in favour of German exporters something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in an underlying loss of productivity as compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public expenditure which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Deep European productivity is sick beyond current budget and currency problems.
As a result of the Green Energy Policies imposed by Brussels to exempt French and German energy firms on consumer expenditures, European industries pay twice as much for electricity as the United Nations and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even the freeze of all wages in the world cannot prevent the European petrochemicals industry from being affected by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, there is a sense of revolt among the people, especially in France, which had once been a major fan of the EU.
After the war, top French politicians saw the EU as a measure of controlling Germany, and providing billing at par with Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, which is pushing the French economy.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, the anti-EU National Front has won the third position by pushing the ruling Socialist to the third position in the recent by-elections.
The front in France is currently the most popular party with 24 per cent vote it is a timely warning to the British Labour that they cannot assume that the dissolution to the left will automatically benefit the right.
What is Le Pen doing with its new popularity among the French whites, the working class?
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to form an anti-EU, anti-currency group in the European Parliament.
If, as far as possible, the EU opposition parties do well in these elections, such a group can influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: Soon the confluence of the anti-EU and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will end the euro.
"The euro will not end completely, but it will return in some form like" "(sovereign) nations Europe," "backed by General de Gaulle."
Germany and some of its subsidiaries can retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I expect the UK to keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing ties with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left to the Cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to remain in the territory of Little England (essentially).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-federal nations to work with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think of maintaining our economic independence on the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland has been significantly the most successful anti-austerity political campaign in Europe, which won an amazing majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tori-Lib Dam alliance, opposing (and implemented) cuts proposed by Labour Chancellor Alastair Darling.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as it would have to accept the rules of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Youth before time: growing up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls attain puberty at a younger age than white girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that youth is near
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be a cause of youth at a young age
Early puberty is not so effective in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Ethridge is an expert journalist on child health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter develops breasts at the age of 7 or 8 and the genitals begin to hatch?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Capovitz clarified that these early physical changes are common among American girls, showing a new trend.
"" "I spend a lot of time assuring parents that it generally does not show rapid progress in the direction of full youth," "says Capovitz."
The direct symptoms of development such as piercing of breasts, genital and thorny hair and physical odors are visible in girls ahead of time.
But there has been a slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (First menstrual) in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, the first sermon takes at least two to three years," "says Capovitz, who is also the author of" "premature youth in girls: the necessary guidelines to deal with this common problem." ""
It is the most accurate testing time for the development of youth.
"There is a debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when breast development increases before the age of 8, two call it" "child-adults." ""
In most of the cases, the process will slow or stop - which the pediatrician can inspect closely.
In case of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to be examined to remove the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatment to delay early menstruation and other outcomes is: premature ageing of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and nata height as adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood of the child.
Psychological aspects are also important.
"Capovitz is aware of drugs but admits," "suppressing youth can raise behavioural issues, and girls may start feeling different from their peers." ""
The second major problem can be understood: Parents do not just want their younger daughter to have menstruation.
"" "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
"A woman whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10 recalls," "It was a shock." ""
Although this was a symptom and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and returned upset that she was the first among her friends to start menstruation.
There are many prevalent theories about the causes of premature youth.
However, there is no sustained evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexually oriented messages in the media can be charged.
Boys are also getting the same pre-mature youth as girls.
Capovitz prescribes that the main cause is the outbreak of obesity.
She had helped conduct studies on girls aged 6 to 9 years in 2001, which connects body fat with puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to get puberty before white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the prototype of premature puberty appears to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other initiatives: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at a young age, the practice of complete puberty is not as clear as that of girls in them.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see oral and genital hair.
"" "We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginnings of youth," "says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Moristown, New Jersey."
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their child doctor to seek his opinion on how to talk to their children.
"Capowitz advised," "This may mean talking ahead of the desired time."
If you remain calm, your child will generally respond properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.

Large orders of Jet manufacturers at stake due to controversy over seat width.
Establishing a rhythm for the fight for the Dubai Airshow this month, there is a competition among the leading aircraft manufacturers to widen the tourist class seats for long distance flights
The controversy focuses on the width of the economy class seat in long-haul flights, not always given by airlines, but whose allotted space efficiency has been claimed to be the key by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus is expected to offer at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide seats in the economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by the airlines, its main competitor Boeing said.
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when the possible order after the 17-21 incident saw a competition to sell the larger version of the twin engine of the long-range aircraft.
How has the previous department of the aircraft been created - especially whether the seat 9 or 10 is equal to the maximum capacity claims are being designed keeping in mind the mini jumbo jets?
Boeing says it has 777 X which will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the dictatorial section.
Airbus says it will compete with the A350 and will take 350 people to a seat with 18 inches left equal to 9.
Aircraft giants often carry out business attacks on technical matters through advertisements in business press.
Now, Airbus with 777 X is expected to dominate over 100 orders at the Dubai Airshow, thus appealing to the public.
Recently it has been seen that whatever has been the beginning of the war of evolution, will you accept it at three times at a restaurant at the same time?
"Airbus Head of Sales John Lehi said," "Boeing is also offering long distance flights from regional Turbo to narrow seats." ""
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way planes sit has not changed.
According to US health department data, between the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 Jumbo ne defined the modern long term Ki Yatra ko, and the centuries-old Ant m average 40-49 year old American male ke me increased by 10 percent.
According to US health statistics, the average American male waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rivals stick to a seat concept in 1950 when the average circumference of the new name Jet Set was narrow.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional 53 per cent improvement in sleep quality in the seat width.
Boeing disputed Airbus seat measurement data, and said it does not depend on the manufacturers decision on how airlines balance fares and facilities.
Research also shows that more than the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin.
"" "It actually tells the airlines to provide flexibility and the things they believe they need to do to succeed," "said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver."
"They don't want to tell us who they benefit from." ""
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it is about elongated room, but for suppliers it is a fast issue that it can affect income.
The trade behind the dispute is estimated to be at least $700 billion. The competition for aircraft orders is enough in the coming decades to tighten the US and European exports.
For the first time in July, what seat layout is actually an issue of a fight between new jets, Reuters reported.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that each seat had 20 per cent performance in their new twin engine design, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 air.
The claim of Boeing's performance depends on the comparison of the 10 to the 777 X One original 9 with the 777 design.
Comparison has now been used 10 equal to profit in unit cost.
"" "This Boeing aircraft is doing to make their products more competitive with our products, to occupy more seats," "said Kevin Kenniston, head of the European Airbus Passenger Facility."
Analysts, on the other hand, say the entire 10-seater per row cabin is suggested for the current 777 S that many passengers are in favour of the Denser layout, which can also go up with cheaper fares.
"" "The 18-inch seat width will be very good for passengers, but the reality is that this business point proposal of Airbus is driven by the threat of 777," "said Mary Karbi, founder and editor's runway girl network"
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but provide a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
Jet sellers from all over the world should also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
While taking more rest, all builders are also providing low-cost airline services of jet aircraft and high density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10 equal A350 but say it is not yet sold.
But recently, as long as Airbus insisted on extensive cabin seats on some of its jets to require more cabin facility.
Modern jet aircraft are unlikely to fly at a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it can distract from the wave of sales of 777 X.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Can End Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The same vaccine dose was capable of keeping rats safe from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further tests are required before testing on humans, which may take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Wheel Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial signs are positive.
"" "We are very hopeful that such a vaccine strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available in the market today, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is far more powerful than these existing methods," "said Professor Cornell."
The new vaccine has an harmless virus designed to deliver genetic information aimed at creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus infects the liver cell selectively, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies discover any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevent the smoker from getting exposed to nicotine by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccinated rats who were later given nicotine continued to perform their normal activities.
"But the rat who was not given the vaccine" "liked," "says the researchers, an indication that nicotine had reached his brain."
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be fed at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high as the liver will make the cell an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before they are tempted to smoke, so that they can be protected from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to quit.
He said that he will know that if they resume smoking, they will not get any pleasure from smoking due to nicotine vaccine which can help them get rid of their habit.
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need for a lot of research.
Even after the post-mortem, the exact cause of the death could not be ascertained.
In response, the Forest Department prima facie termed the death of the tigress as natural.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of Ramnagar Forest Division found the body of a tigress near the Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi drain.
All the organs of the tiger's body were safe and there were no injury or injury marks on it.
The postmortem of the body was conducted on Friday in the presence of Forest Patron Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Haaksha Naseem, SDO GS Karki and veterinary doctor Hema Rathore of Kotabag.
According to sources, the body of the tiger was found to be damaged during the post-mortem.
The exact cause of the death could not be ascertained.
Departmental officials continued to give a befitting reply to the death of the tigress.
However, the internal organs of the tiger have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for topicological examination to confirm the poison.
Conservator of Forests, Western Circle, Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tiger can be said to be natural.
No injury marks were found on the body.
However, a search is underway in the area and Bisra has been sent for confirmation of the poison.
Tripod refuses to be influenced by Obide.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by State Carpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to refute the policy of sea leases on the request of his political guru, Eddie Obaid, a patron of former New South Wales, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
The independent commission against corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obaid had issued patents to several state ministers for violation of policy circulars where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obide, without tender, were renewed after the expiry of his time in August 2005.
Lin Ashpoy, who knew Mr Obide's hidden interests after evidence from the former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the Government had pressurised the introduction of public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, circular enterprises for leases, from which Obaid earned $250 million annually, were renewed from unleased tenders.
Shri Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change on the request of Shri Obaid, Shri Tripodi had urged for a change in the Government Lease Policy
A copy of the phone calls presented at the ICAC in August and September 2007 by Mr.Obaid and Mr.Tripod and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Department of Fisheries, Mr.Obaid after working in the Ministry of Ports
Were the development of the commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation on the issue? asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheeley Mr Trypody.
"No," "Mr Tripodi replied."
I cant remember what was discussed, but it was certainly not.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Israeli fighter jets attacked Syria, officials said.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News.
The official did not specify the purpose, but at least there was a purpose.
The Associated Press reported that the target was the Russian missile SA-125.
Israel has carried out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees can undergo authentication test on 457 visas
"" "The government is considering a" "" authentication "" "test for foreign employees on 457 visas as it aims to expand a stringent action." ""
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a criteria aimed at preventing 457 used to fill up unskilled posts in Australia or to deliver them to family and friends in a covert manner.
Condemning the governments rhetoric about foreign workers, former Labour MP Maxine McQ today said it could provoke Australia's neighbouring countries.
"He told the US India Institute today that strong statements about" "foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" "and" "job first for Australians" "are a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safe labour market."
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been provided security and I would not be surprised if some people in the region had seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures which were earlier considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendon O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, met officials about the traffickers, has implemented five recommended changes while the rest are under consideration.
"If the" "authentication" "criteria are adopted, the visa applicant can be examined whether the nomination is true under circumstances in which the nominee is the owner of the visa sponsor or the person concerned or personal partner."
Professionals may need to keep a calculation of the number of 457 visa holders as earlier businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee, died of suspected heart attack this week after a refugee arrived in a boat on Christmas Island.
The man's troubled nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, an adult cousin tied the knot with him on the same ship.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British Government to enhance Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
Work by HS2 indicates high speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will soon start with the first phase in 2026.
"Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would" "unite Britain." ""
"Scotland Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was" "very excited" "to work with the UK government on the project."
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
On completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of a high speed link between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which was in talks with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Limited to consider rail capacity and possibility of further improving travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes three hours or less likely travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
"According to Baroness Kremer:" "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer."
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity to 18 UK cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected due to HS2.
"According to Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael:" "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
"For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael to make a" "clear" "return of Scotland to the HS2 network."
Mr. Brown pointed out: High speed rail is likely to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire case of high speed rail across the UK.
We are, therefore, excited to work in partnership with the British Government to explore options to bring high speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all, and supply the Glasgow Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the Ministers of the British Government next year and taking a decision together on the further course of action.
Aircraft Power Equipment Rules to remain in force in Australia
In addition to the easing of equipment regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers will have to continue to switch off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to US aviation service companies to change their processes, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during important flight stages, provided they are in aircraft mode.
Passengers can still do this during many flights, but many people do not like to be able to fly and access their e-books etc while landing.
Australian aviation service companies are considering the decision, according to which US airline companies will have to do much to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment at critical stages of the flight in Australia are still effective.
"At present, CASA does not have any specific regulation controlling the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," "the authority said, adding," "The issue falls within the regulations, according to which the airlines have to ensure that the security arrangements are always fully maintained, and the passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members."
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA to expand the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to comply with this change, but asked for further action on the directions of the regulator.
"" "We will welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment as we actually feel it will provide a better experience to the customers as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our aircraft," "the spokesperson said."
Quantas said it will follow the existing rules at the moment.
"" "As per our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used while flying and landing, and we have no immediate plan to change it."
FAA decisions apply to US alarms.
However, we have always been interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US airline company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio defaults from mobile devices, as well as amend their rules booklets, training material, cary-on baggage programme and brief details to passengers.
"" "After verifying the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, it will allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all heights," "the FAA said."
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to switch off their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be safely placed under the seat or kept in upper coaches while taking off and landing.
Silver of Ponbrokers due to difficulty felt by middle class in Singapore
Amirathlinga, born at a Ponshop at the Bendemair Shopping Centre in Singapore, is taking cash by paying her gold bangles, rings and bangles to pay her daughter's school fees.
"" "My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it."
She says, though she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (US $2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of South East Asia where domestic debt is rising Valumax, where they are transacting, became the third ponshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Holding jewellery is not the only way to get cash - in the case of Ms. Amirathlinga, Singapore is $1,300 - but almost as cheap as unsafe bank loans.
Generally, Ponbrokers in Singapore charge 17 per cent per annum, slightly higher than 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender who has a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, Ponbrokers have the benefit of not requiring credit check or proof of salary, and they can provide loans faster than banks.
Millions of people in the region are turning to a ponshop due to increasing living expenses by families and difficulties due to increase in domestic and consumer credit.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial disaster, and cheaper credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low and middle income families are moving to Ponshop to meet their needs due to slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standards and Poors, described the rising domestic gains mainly due to rising mortgages as a risk factor for the debentures of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in terms of GDP in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP as compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged mildly from the technology slowdown this week.
On Thursday, data showed a sustained export slowdown and decline in consumer demand.
"" "The decisive point is that with rising prices, people from the middle to lower classes [of income scale] will try to increase their income in every possible way," "said Song Seng Wun, economist at Malaysian Bank, CIMB."
In the last two years, historically high prices in gold prices have inspired people to mortgage personal properties as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to capitalize on the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items pledged at 200 Pon outlets in the city-state are gold.
People are saying, Gold is looking good, let's mortgage Grandma's gold chain, and take it back next month.
Thailands largest ponshop operator, Eagemony, has seen a 20 per cent growth in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the mortgage business that the outlet operators in Bendimir, Velumax and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighbourhood, Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Ya Lee Ching, executive director, Valumax.
The company will fund it on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week using 60% of the $66 million listed this week.
While some discount lenders have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms. Ya says that the mortgage not only gets cheaper rates as compared to other lenders, but also does not directly increase the loan.
Customers mortgage goods that they already have, and encashing personal assets does not increase domestic debt, she says.
The social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing for short term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only financially weak people use ponbrokers.
Rich people in Singapore also use a valuemax outlet, mortgaging gold bars or Rolex watches to get up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
"" "These include rich people who need short-term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow needs," "says Ms. Ya."
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.

$325 million rescue package for Taji's health
The Union Government has emphasized that there are stringent conditions attached to the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system that will ensure that the State Government does not waste the funds.
"Federal Health Minister Tanya Plybersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking" "immediate action" "to address the current crisis due to the ageing population of the island state, high rates of chronic diseases, and system limitations."
The financing to be done over a period of four years was decided in consultation with the Government along with the Independent Member of Parliament of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package, which we are confident that it will address the specific challenges being faced by the State.
The $325 million package also includes an alternative $31 million surgery plan.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving past collected cases.
This includes funds for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lonesstation, better post-hospitalization care, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of individual electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"" "These investments are in line with the best practices offered to me by leading doctors to improve Tasmania's health system."
The Minister emphasized that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability governance.
The State has to maintain the present level of funding to receive Commonwealth funds, and report every month on where the additional fund is being spent.
A three member Commission will be constituted to ensure effective and efficient service delivery by the State.
Mr. Wilkie said that $325 million will not mean much unless the real reforms are carried out to take Tasmania's public health system to a more affordable level.
However, he praised the Government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.
"" "I hope the federal assistance package will be very helpful in separating the state from the crisis-hit list of public health systems."
According to the State Government, these additional alternative procedures will mainly revive the recent deductions.
"But Federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that todays announcement is a" "band-aid solution." ""
We are here because the Labour State Government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You cannot consider the nearly half a billion dollars taken by the state government and the $300 million given by the Commonwealth as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plybersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation of Dennis Diderot's novel by Gillum Nikoloux details the best production design and time period, but it has become much more than it should have.
Reflecting the time of 1760 in France, the novel, Susan, narrates the tragic story of young Rais, sent by his family member to the convent.
When she rebels, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the autocratic mother Superior, and becomes a erotic attraction for the other.
The film never goes into sexuality or sensationalism - and that is the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the narration, there is also the risk of making a boring film for the audience.
Dr. Munna Singh, Vice Chancellor, CSA has decided to levy entry fee in the garden due to the garbage in the park.
A 15-day ultimatum has been given to the departments to rectify the situation.
The Vice Chancellor along with the Department of Horticulture conducted a surprise inspection of Deputy Director Seed and Field and Director Research at 10 am on Friday.
During this period, he found more than a dozen employees including directors in these departments missing from his seat.
After reprimanded, he warned of a salary cut if he was found absent the next time.
Dr Naushad Khan, media in-charge of the university, said a pass of Rs 30 will be required for a month-long tour.
People can go to the garden at a fee of Rs 1 per day.
System work to be done: The files relating to various functions before the Vice Chancellor will be delivered under one system.
Every employee shall not be entitled to enter the office of the Vice Chancellor with his / her file.
The concerned authorities will take their final call to the Vice Chancellor.
The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its chemical weapon manufacturing capacity
On Thursday, the monitoring group said Syria has destroyed critical equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and toxic gas combat materials, while a violent conflict has emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the site where toxic agents are believed to be deployed.
At the same time, the Syrian movement group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, which began about three years ago.
The announcement was made a day before the last date of 1st November
"This was determined by the Hague-based organization to destroy or" "ineffective" "the machinery used to inject chemicals into all chemical weapon production units and toxic gases and fill the war material."
The completion of the initial phase of the destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer develop new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1000 MT of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent Sarin.
The UK based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came at a time when the conflict in Safira city escalated on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapon production unit as well as a collection centre.
The movement group, which contains details of the death toll through the network of movements in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
This includes 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government has said that 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the military, 18,678 are fighters in favour of the government and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that 2,202 Army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Nearly two million people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Asad's army fought the rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom belonged to Al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said people from both sides were injured, but did not say anything clearly.
The war reflects the threat posed by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short time.
"The OPCW, which has worked closely with the United Nations, said its team is" "satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all the declared critical production and blending / filling equipment in Syria as destroyed." ""
No further inspection activity is being planned.
Earlier this week, inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were not able to visit the two centres due to security reasons.
"On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centres" "have been abandoned and... the chemical weapon products kept there were moved to other declared centres, which have been inspected." ""
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira was one of the two centres where the Inspector of OPCW was not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
"In a comment issued by OPCW, Director General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmet Ujumku said," "I salute the perseverance and courage displayed by you in fulfilling the most challenging mission undertaken by this organization so far."
The civil war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly a conflict between the government of Assad and its security forces, including members of the Alavite sect, which emerged from Shia Islam, and the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In another development, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said a massive explosion took place on Wednesday at the Air Defence Centre in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia.
The reason for the explosion has still not been identified.
The police have recovered fake registry, fake seals, laptops and photocopies of fake registry from the possession of the accused.
The police has registered cases against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said the arrested accused have been identified as Rajeev Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Haibowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has fled from the spot.
According to the police, the accused used to collect documents from the records of vacant and old land along with the clerk and record keeper of the registrar office, Balbir Singh, and then buy new stamp papers and create a fake registry on them.
It was not only then that the real registry disappeared and the fake registry entered the record.
Thereafter, the accused used to sell the land on forged documents for crores of rupees.
They used to take loans on these fake documents.
After this, the real owner of the land remained a bullying account of the police and the administration.
The accused, who had set up a fake registry, used to keep a close watch on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell fake registries of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that during interrogation, the accused revealed that they have prepared around 150 fake registries so far.
According to the police, a case of cheating and theft has been registered against Rajiv Gandhi.
Protests erupt in Bali over conspiracy to bomb blast
The families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bomb blast have expressed anguish over the punishment given to the mastermind of the bomb blast, saying Omar Patel should face the firing team.
Patel, who ran as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for about 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building an explosive device used in the bomb blast.
He can be released in 15 years on parole.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass killing by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring a large number.
He was also found guilty of several other terror-related charges, including the series of bomb blasts at a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
"The prosecutors had sought life imprisonment, though they could also demand that the man, known as the" "subversive person" "as a bomb maker, be sentenced to death."
The decision restored the painful memories of the woman from Perth, June Cortin, who had lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patel and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his spirits, he said Patel should have been awarded the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
"Ms. Cortin told the AAP," "He should be placed in front of the firing team."
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
Just at 11 pm on October 12, 2002, the club was wiped out after a bomb was loaded in a van parked outside The Sari Club.
Peter Hughes was in the Padies Bar at the time of the explosion just 20 seconds before the explosive packet was carried out by suicide bombers.
They went into a month-long coma as a result of the bomb blast and died three times while on life saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that Patel should have received the same punishment as three other members of the Jammah Islamiyah terror group responsible for the massacre - Amaroji, Muhalas and Imam Samudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be sentenced to death before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, the 20 years in prison is not enough.
Patel is the last person to be punished in Bali bomb blasts.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but finally in January 2011, he was arrested in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the US military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report revealed that Patel was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to restore connectivity between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
She did not surrender, says Ms. Cortin.
Even today, he does not really have the pain of torturing so many people.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"Ms. Cortin said," "There will be a lot of tears this year."
Patel can still appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Aircraft passengers can now use gadgets in aircraft (but cannot make calls from cell phones)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from entering the gate but not to talk to their cell phones under the highly anticipated new guidelines issued by the federal aviation administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
Speaking at a news conference, FA Administrator Michael Hurta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different for each airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft complete the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training booklets and devices of their crew members to display the guidelines.
The FA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted their plans.
Based on the status of the scheme, we can approve the extended use of the electronic device very quickly, the FA said in a statement.
At present, passengers are required to switch off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected not to operate the aircraft till it reaches a height of 10,000 feet and is allowed by the Captain.
Passengers are required to switch off their devices again at the time of landing, and not operate the aircraft till it is completely disembarked.
"" "Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully safe from electronic disruptions can allow their passengers to use the device while flying, landing and taxing," "the FA said."
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft which have been modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleding, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has welcomed these changes.
"" "When the policy is implemented safely - and we will work with airlines to do so - it will be a victory for both sides," "Gladding said in a statement."
When it comes to this issue, we are tired of feeling like Hall Monitors.
However, surfing by connecting the internet at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, exchange of emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still remain prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So there will still be no interaction with friends, an online Scrable-like game, the famous event associated with which actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while at the gate park in 2011, and was offloaded by American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device.
And heavy equipment like laptops etc., will still have to be collected as their jumping will cause concern for injury to another person in the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will also remain prohibited during the flight.
The regulatory authority relating to phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FAA.
FAA can lift restrictions on some electronic devices during flight and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenken of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
"" "Cell phones are really a serious issue, not just because they can potentially disrupt navigation devices, but also because they can disrupt cell phone towers when they are in the air," "Rozenker said."
The Industry Advisory Committee constituted by the FAA to look into the issue has recommended last month that the Government should allow greater use of individual electronic devices.
The use of these has been exacerbating pressure on the FAA in recent years to reduce restrictions.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCassilk, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more and more difficult to enforce as the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to close their device.
The FA started banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when reports of disruption in navigation and communication equipment were received by passengers due to FM radio and high technology gadgets at that time.
New airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved to be resistant to electronic interference by the FAA.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi from passengers at rising altitudes over the years.
The modified aircraft for Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to disruption.
Most airlines should meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Hurta said.
Modern electronic devices emit very low power radio transmission as compared to previous generation electronic devices.
For example, e-readers have a quite nominal transmission during page swapping.
But transmission is dominant when the device downloads or sends the data.
Amazon.com Inc. has also been one of the stakeholders to reduce the restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems but there was no such problem.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risk of use of the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aircraft Passengers Association said he believes that the disruption to the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the Committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the disruption by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the Committee recommended that allow the FAA pilot to order the passengers to switch off the device at the time of landing in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and described them as a common knowledge facility for people travelling in the latest phase of technology.
Roger Doe, CEO, US Travel Association, said, We are happy that the FA has recognized that the passenger travelling with Anand is not inconsistent with rescue and safety.
Learning from the serial bomb blasts in Patna, the UT police have geared up to celebrate Diwali in view of security and quick response in times of emergency.
A total of 1800 constables, including vehicles, will patrol all the main points of the city, crowded markets and other places to arrest those involved in other incidents including smooth movement of traffic, prevention of incidents of snatching, teaching of lessons to the people.
These personnel will include women police personnel including PCR, traffic unit.
Police personnel and commandos will also be on alert at hotels, guest houses and other places in the city.
The police have constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the case.
The DSP, including the Inspector, has been entrusted with the task of investigating the VIP sectors of the city, markets, malls and other places.
In view of the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the higher authorities have also fixed duties of additional police personnel under the police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The police have asked the fire department and the PGI Director, Principal Director and DHS along with the staff of the Sector 16 GMSH and Sector 32 GMCH management as well as other dispensaries to remain on high alert during the emergency.
In order to teach a lesson to the minds, the departmental officers have now hired women police personnel and others on duty under the leadership of NGOs as anti-goonda staff.
The police personnel of the anti-goondas staff team will be on standby at crowded places including markets in plain clothes.
On Diwali, all SHOs have been ordered to set up 44 nakas in the inner areas of the city.
Police personnel will also be deployed at 38 nakas at the city borders.
The bird was airlifted back to the forest to protect it from the North Sea Rig
The bird found floating on the North Sea Oil Rig has been released back into the forest by air transport.
The water rail bird was sent to Aberdeen by a helicopter before being recovered by the Scottish SPCA at their rescue center in Aloa.
"Central Manager Colin Sedan said:" "This water train was probably the winter migratory bird of Northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea."
It seems the bird was tired and took shelter on the oil rig.
"He further added:" "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
The water train had become healthy and fit before it was released.
Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April and a pledge was taken to bring business together and determine what changes UK's employment and prosperity makers want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For this, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of the UK's business with the EU.
U-Gove took the views of 1000 business leaders who represent the business size, regions and locations of the UK.
The findings of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming motionless.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil and not engage in a long and arduous process of reform of the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked about his views on specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could have been seen very easily, with businessmen saying that the price of regulation of Brussels is much higher than the benefits of being a part of the European business sector even 40 percent of the large businessmen who traditionally advocated European companies agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wanted the UK to move ahead on the path of trade based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
"This conclusion, which was seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are driving a" "meaningful change" "that would return its lost power to the UK."
It has a very high price - the issue of treaty changes and getting a better deal for the UK changed 16 per cent of the vote in favour of remaining in the EU in the referendum.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: this survey shows that British businessmen support his plan to negotiate terms of Britain's membership to the EU.
It also showed that professionals require a meaningful change and renegotiation to make the current power balance in favour of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly inevitable, as the Eurozone is moving towards a closed economy and a fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show that for businesses, it means a new focus on trade and fundamental change in Brussels's regulatory methodology.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline as the beginning of a new era in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said the launch of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
Today is a historic event: Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The South Stream will diversify Russias export routes to Europe.
"" "In Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas for Europe is part of Russia's gas, a dispute related to the contract between Gazprom's counter and Gazprom presents a risk for traditional routes," "officials said."
"Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries end" "forever." ""
After the completion of the project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will get gas at subsidized rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two employees of YMCA charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord
Two employees of YMCANSW have been charged with child sexual offences before being charged against Carringbah child care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in its statement before the Commission, it said that it never reported child sexual abuse within its organization, the Commission was informed.
CEO Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which YMCA Carringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told advocate Gail Furnace, who assisted the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that an external inquiry of YMCA has been conducted and he has found YMCA at the forefront of child protection is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified, and it achieved the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Education and Community Department Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management, including me himself, has failed to ensure that the employees are clearly aware of their obligations to inform them of child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 children during his two-year tenure at YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years imprisonment.
However, Mr. Hare declined the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem due to which the employees did not inform about the violation of child safety by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the violations, they provided evidence that the Lord was spending time alone with the children, making them personally babysitting, putting them in his arms, telling them that he loved them and allowing them to play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's supervision, and had asked for child protection training, as she was concerned about her behavior, testified that YMCA Carringbah, the Lord's supervisor, was very intimidating and difficult to meet Jackie Bernat, a child care manager.
The CEO said that it did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
Rather, his friendship with Lord misled his decision to inform him about him, he said.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his vision to the YMCANSW Mandal that Jonathan Lord was about not informing the text for the organization from the event.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the Privacy Agreement by the employees was taken by William Whitley, General Manager, Child Services, YMCA immediately after the allegations surfaced.
"He said that the aim was to avoid a combination of evidence, but it was" "over-enthusiastic" "and not executed properly."
Stephen Smallbone, Special Professor of Child Sexual Abuse at the University of Griffith, said YMCANSW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2099 and 2011.
"He said that there were" "serious problems" "in appointment, monitoring, entry, training and supervision of employees."
The hearing has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like to be the British Prime Minister again but he believes there is no chance of a comeback.
In a night interview from the Prime Ministers Office on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After resigning as leader in June 2007, most of his comments were largely refrained from discussing British politics, limiting to his own role as a representative of foreign affairs and Middle East Group peacekeepers.
"Asked if he would like to return as Prime Minister, Mr Blair was presented by Londons Evening Standard newspaper, saying:" "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When Cardiff had a crowd of experts showcasing horses for the best horse of the year, he knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three year old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even went to school and a few months away from taking his first step, the little child and his pet Shetland's Tattu Tafy completed three phases very easily and won the top prize leaving behind their 30 adult rivals.
In the annual competition organized by the Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Rudri near Cardiff, the unbreakable pair of Sk, which is the same length, was highly appreciated for their appearance, behavior, and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful bowler hats, he dived his flat cap at an elbow angle and turned his two-year-old toffee around the ring.
Fenton was praised by the decision makers for his natural ability to control that is far ahead of his age.
And Tofi got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was gifted a toffee in March last year on his third birthday, and has practiced with the Shetland tattoo daily since then.
"Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said:" "Fenton and Tofi are great couples."
He had faced a challenge from all the candidates but both of them won the Gold Cup and the Rojet.
This was just the second time he had participated in a competition with Tofi, and we are all very happy with his victory.
Above all, he felt so wonderful that he wanted to take a photo with him.
The little boy from Nantiglo village near Ab Well, South Wales is walking on the footprints of his anti-Sharon Howels, who have been performing horses for more than 10 years.
"Mr. Howells said:" "The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating and clapping."
He was running on sand throughout the theatre, and despite looking so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is fond of animals - he loves horses, tractors and fields, and he has raised two chickens he takes care of.
The way he has started will be at the best horse exhibition of the year long ago and I am sure he will do very well.
"A spokesperson for the annual horse exhibition said:" "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to control his tattoo."
They are a very good pair.
The decision makers gave points in view of the way Fenton and Tofi performed and the way they performed in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tattu and his rider Fenton and Tofi were the best in the ring.
I am confident that Fenton's lovely clothes have helped him, he looked really different.
"" "There will be" "" Restoration "" "of the arguing Chinese newspaper" "
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the homepage to release a journalist guilty of defamation will be revived, said a press regulator.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express had made a rare public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But then Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write a fabricated report about the state's part-time owned company.
"The regulator said the New Express now has to go through a" "complete reform." ""
The reform order came from the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
A preliminary investigation has shown that New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about Zumlion, a listed company, between September 2012 and August 2013.
"" "The editorial management of New Express was unstable."
It said it had decided to impose an administrative penalty by cancelling the licence of the Chen Yongzhou reporter.
It had directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete reform of the New Express, the New Express had recommended an inquiry of those responsible and an immediate revision of the New Express leadership team.
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Jumlion.
After his detention, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for his release, saying he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But then Mr. Chen came to state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
"" "In this case, I have harmed Jumlion as well as the entire news Miya industry and its ability to win the trust of the people," "he told state broadcaster CCTV."
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realised my mistake.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a homepage apology stating that it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have confessed to TV transmission.
Experts say that even though confession is made by force from time to time, a law in the latter half of this year forbade authorities to compel a person to blame himself.

Self-railway found in US-Mexico drug tunnel
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between USA and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
U.S. authorities have described the four feet times three feet tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is equivalent to a terracotta length of about six football pitches, connecting the godown near Tijuana, Mexico, and the San Diego, USA.
The area is full of godowns that make it easier to hide the truck being loaded with drugs.
It was closed before any drug could pass through the tunnel, the officials said.
According to court records, the authorities have seized eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the search of the tunnel.
Three persons, who were reported to be working as drivers, were accused of possessing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, he can be sentenced to 10 years in prison and up to life imprisonment.
In Nogles, Arizona, smugglers take advantage of huge underground drainage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the Marijuana crop in central Mexico, which presents the challenge of drug mafia groups capable of delivering the product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found about 700 yards of rail track equipped with rail tracks, extending from a kitchen of a house in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.

British police sends extradition notice to Assange
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London and requested for shelter.
Scotland Yard said he had sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, and said he would be responsible for his arrest if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences and his options under British law came to an end when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the US, he had requested asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
"A spokesperson said Scotland Yard has" "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, for which he needed to appear at the police station on the date and time chosen by us." ""
He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that with the issuance of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-privacy website called Wikileaks, the United States will be extradited from Sweden to face possible espionage charges.
Man fined 1000 pounds (1,000) for driving 130 miles per hour with hot drink between feet
The driver has been fined 1,000 pounds (1,000) for drunken driving at a speed of 130 mph (210 km / h).
Andrew Howy, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was seen running his Mercedes Benz on A120 in Brentree on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found take-away drinks on their feet.
In the Colchester Magistrate Court, Howy has admitted the charge of reckless driving.
Seven points were added to his license, resulting in a six-month ban on him from driving.
Howy was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 (90) and a victim surcharge of 100 (100).
Tax on Foreign Property Owners to End London Artificial Limbs
The Department of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who introduced stamp duty at the rate of 7% for houses costing more than 2 million pounds in the 2012 budget, and persons who prefer to keep a house in a company instead of a separate person.
The stamp duty received from residential properties in Westminster and cities of Kensington and Chelsea in 2012 / 13 was 708 million, which is already higher than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hamber.
Mr. Cook pointed out: After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property has a fair minimum tax, which has nothing to do with the impact of the old Council tax system.
"" "But this move can make some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and reluctant to sell to existing owners"
Prime Property, the top 5-10% of the value of the housing market in wealthier south-west London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has registered a record growth of 11.8% last year.
"According to Savils research, Central London prices continued to grow by 5.6 per cent every year, but seemed to be slightly lower than the" "domestic market" "as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) is witnessing a surge."
Scientists have further highlighted the relationship between dog tail activity and its mood.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from dog point of view), while restless dogs move their tail more mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can identify this subtle distinction of tail and react to it.
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.
"Professor Georgia Wellertigra, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said:" "In humans, it is well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved differently in the stimulation that produces positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He said that even in dogs, like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for left-hand actions and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral milking by other dogs, the researchers watched animals watching other dog films.
He measured the heart beats of pet dogs and analysed their behavior.
We will probably not take much time to understand why their tail moves on one side and on the other.
"Professor Vellartigra explained:" "We introduced dogs with dog films in the realistic version or in the shadow to deal with other issues confusing, and we could see the tail movement and present the tail more left or right."
When the animals saw an emotional dog moving its tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they were completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail turning mainly to the left (from the dog's point of view), his heart swelled and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and not on whom.
"He said:" "If you have met other dogs several times, and if they constantly move their tail on one side, it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience."
These findings can provide better information about animal emotions to owners, veterinarians and trainers, the researchers said.
John Bradshaw, a guest fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, an expert on dog behaviour, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
"In other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, he said:" "Unlike the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail was moved to the left rather than to the right, the dogs were more likely to approach him than be restless."
He said that this difference was because in various studies dogs were not fully considering animals or robots dogs as dogs in films.
He clarified that the study of the way dogs react to real dogs can help.
"While there is considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is yet to be received - and dogs are no exception in this case," "he said."
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not take much time to understand why their tail moves on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkey postpones Glasgow Gigg due to Alex Turner's illness
The Rock Bank, Arctic Monkey, has postponed Gigg in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered from throat pain.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to hold a demonstration at the Hydro site in the city on Friday.

Pope Francis to announce first cardinal in February
The Vatican on Thursday announced that Pope Francis would set up a new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest class priests in the Catholic Church, whose position is only below the Pope, and these are the ones who choose the Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his individuals, who will eventually help them choose their successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals at present.
However, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pope's election - it falls in a group of 120 cardinal selectors.
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardy said a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held before the inauguration of the new cardinals, called the pope meeting.
"" "Pope Francis has decided to inform in advance about his decision to hold the Pope Council of February so that it becomes easier to plan other cardinal meetings with different countries of the world," "Lombardi said."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline by February.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, the number of cardinals, and the names of cardinal above 80 years of age as per his wishes.
The pope meeting next year will be important as it will be the first pop-meeting after Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
It will be interesting to see if new popes nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance.
South America has 40 percent of Roman Catholics, but their number in cardinals is very low.
These will also be the first cardinals to be elected after Francis formed the Cardinals Council, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose work is to find ways to reform the church.
Earlier, the pope used to decide everything on his own.
"" "At the moment, Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him."
"He said it is" "possible" "to seek advice from Francis Cardinals."
But we have not been in this situation before - this is completely new.
"Valero said that the pope usually appoints the bishop of the larger places as a cardinal, but Francis was" "totally astounding - so we don't know whose name they will announce." ""
GM recalled pickup trucks to the US to correct the seatback
According to a report by US auto safety regulators on Friday, General Motors has recalled around 19,000 trucks to correct a reduction in handheld seating back in its latest 2014 Chevrolet Silverdo and GMC Sira pickup trucks
There may be a shortage of front seat rotation system in some trucks.
As a result, the Sangh failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding seat back, head resident.
"According to a information posted on the website of the National Highways Traffic Safety Administration," "If the vehicle gets stuck from behind, it is possible that the head resident does not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury." ""
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks started sending in June and, after the bankruptcy renewal in 2009, it shows the most important wagon launch for the top US automaker
GM had informed the truck owners about the fault in the latter half of October.
The owner could not review the notification due to the 16 day government prisoner, which had disrupted the growth in auto sales in October.
The sale of Silverdo and Sera Trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, registered a growth of 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverdo and 16,503 Sira pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, GM shares jumped 1.4 per cent in the New York Stock Exchange
Obamas voters cry for disappointment
I voted twice for Obama in the hope of change
He says Obamas great efforts have been hampered by the GOP's policy of obstruction
Obamacare website suffering, cannot excuse drone attacks
The memoir of the 2008 Obama campaign reminds us of what could have happened
Moris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books these days.
This is a book I think this second year will boost my enthusiasm during the tragedy of the medical school and give me a ray of hope.
"It is called the" "Courage to Win," "and a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign."
When I am able to move through the pamphlets of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time when politics had inspired millions of people and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical significance of the time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents preserved each newspaper.
A group of young visionary people were going to the White House, and the entire country was ready for change.
During Obamas presidency in 2008, he had 82 per cent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, such as the return of dreams from the world.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
There was a real change after I voted for the first time.
Simply put, none of this could have imagined.
I give credit to Obama for many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, from the end of the No Ask, to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Further, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has hindered many efforts for our country to move forward: immigration reforms, public options for healthcare, closure of the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But a number of times when I would take my own side of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I would have the answer that I could give them.
I have reached the point of political despair.
The Republican opposition policy is not the answer to foreign leaders espionage, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency collecting data about the personal life of ordinary American citizens nor can it respond to prosecution of those who expose the wrong actions of the government.
It cannot give the reason for the killing of American citizen Anwar El Awlaki without a trial, nor is it a reduction in public funds and expenditure limits during the presidential campaign.
"It cannot answer the findings of the report that White House attempts to silence the media have been" "the most aggressive since the Nixon administration." ""
And most recently, it cannot excuse its failure to design a simple website even after three years of its signing in the Act of Affordable Care.
I dont know if I had expected this.
If, at the age of 18, I should have speculated that the governance system could refute the political campaign that would bring it forward.
Clearly, the elected office is not a predictable route, as the opposition political party and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public discussion.
However, the examples I have given above seem to have been largely elected by the administration itself.
This bothers you the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidature.
Mitt Romney presented an confusing and uncertain option, which did not appear to determine his policies or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes that we had been hearing about for a long time.
However, while Obamas permissible rating is less than 45 per cent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 through that book.
Seeing it reminds me of their lost promises.
I was reading a part of the book this week, describing how Clinton did not suffer much due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to go back on track, and remain loyal to their objectives.
I want to get my sojo back, he said.
We should remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are that of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that the interest of PM Tony Abbott about the ancestral holiday plan is a conflict of interest
billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the ancestral holiday scheme is a struggle as his daughters can become pregnant and take advantage of it.
The mining sector expert, who is embroiled in a controversy over payment of $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed to have tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control the Senate by up to four votes, which can be important in determining the reduction of carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from policies.
"" "In case of a given parental leave, they may have an important interest struggle because if any of their daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest in getting leave or not."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer as the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after his re-election.
Mr. Palmer sought restoration of election counting to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters are Frances and Bridget.
Should the election result come two months after we voted?
We should have a better system.
Why cant we have a system in which we fill our returns on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6: 30 in the evening.
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencil for marking ballot papers.
So, because if a person does not like him, can he be erased?
In modern times, it seems absurd to use pencil.
The Election Commission is studying the options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a Joint Discussion Paper with New Zealand.
"Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies included the construction of an international airport for Sunshine Coast, and he would take his new work" "very seriously." ""
Public office is for public service.
We do not need any awards other than the awards of history that we can serve the community at this crucial time.
This posed problems for the litigants.
Addressing a gathering on the occasion, Bar Association president Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his anguish over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said that the rapidly growing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that criminals have become fearless.
They are not afraid of the police or the administration.
Referring to such recent incidents at different places, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily gauged.
RBS suspends two forex traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Department of Foreign Exchange, two experts in the case have received information, another indication that global scrutiny by regulators is progressing at a rapid pace in suspected currency market manipulation.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are collaborating with regulators to investigate the worlds largest financial market with a daily exchange of $5.3 trillion.
Both these traders will be the first employees of the RBS, who have been suspended as the investigation into the case appears to be a repeat of the Libor inter-bank loan fraud case continues.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension and confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the regulators this month.
"" "We are investigating the matter, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators."
Last month, experts in the case had said that the RBS had sent the emails and quick messages received from the former trader to the UK Regulatory, Financial Ethics Authority.
The trader, Richard Yusher, left the RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as the European Chief of Forex Spot Trading in J. P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in the city, had gone on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts from the case said that Mr. Yushers quick messaging group includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
The UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after it was reported by the Swiss regulator, Finma, that it was investigating suspicious foreign exchange market manipulation in many Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Competition Authority of Switzerland - are investigating allegations of misappropriation of funds by the Department of Justice at VCO, FCA, the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - bankers for their favourable currency market volatility.
HSBC, Citigroup, J. P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal inquiry, or received requests for information from regulators.
Banks are closely checking instant messages and emails equivalent to many years in search of clues to any wrong activity.
About the investigation, the news has created a stir among the traders in the sector who have been among the top profit-making individuals in the trading unit of investment banks for the last several years, but they are facing a challenge this year as there has been a decline in opportunities for bookies due to low currency volatility.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it was impossible to manipulate the huge and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say it was not necessary to be true.
"The senior trader said that despite the huge volume of foreign exchange purchases and sales, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of your own platform by banks means" "you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price." ""
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced the dismissal of the trader from its Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London this week, which had incurred a loss of about $6 million at the end of the previous year
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"Credit Suisse said," "We are confident that the trader worked alone, and has been controlled."
Students studying technical and management courses in the campus will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The Vice Chancellor of the University has written to the Governor seeking permission to hold elections.
As the admission process began in the university, there was a demand for student union elections.
He had also launched a signature campaign to select his representative to convey his voice to the university administration and college management.
Around two dozen students enrolled in the campus, including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science, will be able to elect their representatives this year.
More than 6000 students studying here will get the opportunity to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice Chancellor Prof Ashok Kumar informed that permission has been sought from the Governor for holding elections in the University.
The election date will be announced shortly.
"" "It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges."
Many college management do not want student union elections to be held on their campus.
At the same time, elections are not being held due to lack of unity among the students.
The Council had launched a signature campaign for the elections.
Akash Jaiswal, Department Convenor, ABVP
After Diwali, permission will be sought from the district administration to hold elections in colleges.
It is also facing problems due to lack of clarity on the views of the colleges regarding the student union elections.
People have bought a lot of gold and silver from utensils in the capital on Dhanteras.
Such purchases have increased by 20-30 per cent over the previous year
A large number of people thronged jewellery shops in Shimla.
There was also a huge crowd of utensils shops decorated from Lower Bazar to Malroad.
Though such items have been receiving inflation this year, people have not shown any hesitation in buying at an auspicious time.
The auspicious day for shopping on Friday was 7: 52 am to 10: 12 am and 1: 56 to 3: 37 pm and 6: 17 pm to 8: 12 pm.
During the said three moments, a large number of people gathered in the suburbs including Shimla to buy more.
People could not find a place to walk in the Shimla Lower Market.
Similar was the case in every small and big shop.
In such a situation, shopping on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as the Trayodashi Dhantrayodashi of Krishna Paksha in the month of Kartik, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
Supreme Court Supports Obama Healthcare Law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law in the name of Barack Obama as constitutional.
With 5-4 votes, the Judges ruled in favour of a separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act which would require citizens to buy or punish health insurance before 2014 that it was constitutional under the power of the Government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thomas, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court has also supported the remaining articles of the 2700-page Act, and said that the condition of the Health Services Act that the States enhance Medicaid eligibility or that they will lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was filed by 26 States and National Confederation of Independent Business to restrain the Act.
During the early session of 2012, the law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including the hypothetical nominee Mitt Romney.
Of course, our work cannot be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest necessities of life, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
Dhanteras is celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Kartik.
Dhanteras is worshipped by Kuber, the god of wealth, and Yamraj, the god of death.
Money plays an important role in our lives and religion.
No money is good or bad.
Our feelings for money are good and bad.
Wealth cannot be more valuable than the welfare of humanity, but the wealth that causes arrogance has no meaning.
Let us earn money for the holy purpose and spend it for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of every individual to make money for the maintenance of the family.
It should also have a sense of spending some part of it on the society, but an unaccounted collection or a tendency to earn Yen-Ken kind of money destroys our conscience, personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in mind.
A fraction of the money you give can also become the basis of someones life.
We all should think about the fact that many people in the society are living in dire straits.
In fact, the Purushathas of life give equal importance to meaning, religion, work and salvation.
Everyone prays for money and success and gets money and fame according to their Purushartha.
The same wealth is sustainable with which respect is associated.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he cannot consume it properly or be useful to others.
Do not covet someone else with money.
The true rich is he who makes the way out in the myriad hands of wealth.
There can be no greater benefit of money than job creation for others.
Another thing, money is not just about money.
It would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of this money.

Special Judge IS Mehta allowed the NIA's plea and sent Ahmed to 14-day judicial custody.
According to sources, Ujair Ahmed was mainly involved in the incident along with Indian Mujahideen members Imtiaz Ansari and Haider, the main accused in the Patna serial blasts.
Ahmed had introduced several other terrorists to Ansari.
The NIA also wants to arrest other accused in the case through questioning of Ahmed.
A search operation is still underway to nab the terrorists involved in the attack.
For this, they have to take Ahmed to Bihar, Jharkhand and several states for which he needs to be taken on remand.

The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed that the 2012 PMT was rigged a day ago.
The STF has found discrepancies in the roll numbers of 700 students in the investigation.
Out of these, about 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admission of these students may be cancelled.
Following the revelation of STF, the Medical Education Department has started a brainstorming to cancel the admission of these students.
According to information, the department is awaiting a list of all these suspected students from the STF.
A list will be sent to Vyapam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this regard.
Departmental officials say that it has been one year since the students enrolled in 2012, it is necessary to seek legal advice in this regard.
Medical Education Department officials are not in a position to say anything as the matter is confined to the STF investigation.
Vyapam operator Tarun Pithore said if the STF submits a list of suspected students with evidence, their admission will be cancelled immediately.
Director Medical Education Dr Nirbhay Srivastava said that the students have not even refused to cancel their admission if they are found to be fake admission.
According to STF officials, fake students involved in PMT for the year 2012 are being investigated.
After investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
Vyapam had cancelled the eligibility of 345 suspected students appearing in the PMT examination held in 2013.
Out of these 345, the Medical Education Department has so far cancelled 84 admissions.
MLA from Poonch, Aijaz Jan, inaugurated a water cooler at the gurdwara premises.
The MLA said a large number of people used to visit the gurdwara but due to lack of proper drinking water arrangements, water coolers have been installed.
This will enable people to get cold water during summer.
Pure plain water will be available during the winter season.
This will solve the problem of drinking water for the devotees.
Members of the Gurudwara Committee and others were present on the occasion.
After the general elections, if the new government continues its policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, then kerosene will not be available at these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where the sale of kerosene is to stop are Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, the sale of kerosene is also set to stop in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some northeastern states.
According to Petroleum Ministry sources, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two grounds.
First of all, rapid power connections are being created in rural areas.
The second is LPG connection.
That is, in most of the rural households in the States where LPG connections have been given, the sale of PDS Kerosene is being stopped.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is working in this direction.
The sale of PDS Kerosene in Delhi has already stopped since October 2013.
According to sources, the kerosene quota for Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been significantly reduced under this policy.
Punjab's quota has been reduced from 2.72 lakh kilolitres to 1 lakh kilolitres.
The allocation for Uttarakhand has been reduced by 70 per cent and that of Haryana by about 40 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there have been no reports of shortage of kerosene from these states.
The Ministry is of the view that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
At present, there is a difference of Rs 37 between PDS Kerosene and Diesel.
This will encourage adulterators.
In states where PDS will be discontinued, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
Oil companies are currently incurring losses of more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The kerosene subsidy burden is estimated to be around Rs. 31,000 crore in 2013-14.
The accused used to cheat in the name of trading of shares by opening the accounts of investors citing the trading firm.
This is perhaps the first time in the state that such disclosures have led to fraud of crores of rupees.
The police are yet to reach the kingpin of the gang, but seven people, including the accused, have been detained by the police in the state.
The gang used to run a fake commodity market called Metattrader-5.
The company officials used to take cash from investors and create fake IDs on a fake software.
This used to make the accused see the shares purchased by the investors on trading.
It used to find out which share was purchased at what price.
In fact, no shares were purchased and there was no transaction as no demat account of investors was opened and shares were shown to be false on this fake software.
The police suspect that hundreds of people were involved in the racket.
An investment of Rs. 2 to 5 lakh was made in the name of making profits from each investor.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been arrested by the Cyber Cell from Jodhpur while six others have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohre, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.

BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Congress while addressing an election rally in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital in Pune.
"" "Sometimes a coalition government was formed in many states and at the Centre, sometimes a coalition government was formed by the Congress, sometimes by the communists and sometimes by the BJP."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What did the party do?
If there is a comparative outcome, the country will not be asked whether a BJP government should come or not.
Wherever the BJP government has been formed, efforts have been made to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
This country is a witness to that inflation was low under the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man used to get food twice.
But when the Congress or the government was formed with its support, the poor did not get enough to feed the poor.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader is responding to what he did in nine and a half years.
Even the media of our country is not able to reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They dont talk to the media.
Elections are of the Lok Sabha, you should answer to the people.
"Attacking Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi said," "Every day questions are being asked to Modi."
In a democracy, there should be no ruler in Delhi, there should be servants.
There cannot be a Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends leave the balloons every day.
Congress friends, we have appeared for the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, people are elected.
A case has been filed against Google, Samsung and Huawei in the Nartel patent case.
The group, owned by thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed several patent cases against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, which it had overtaken in the Nortel insolvency auction.
Rockstar, an association that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents also include technology that combines words searched on the internet with relevant ads, which are a major part of Googles search business, the charge said.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Googles Android operating system that compete with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel Patents.
Google finally proposed $4.4 billion by increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons why Motorola had a long list of patents.
"" "Despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suite in the auction, Google has violated, and is continuously violating"
Rockstar has sought enhanced compensation against Google as it claims to be a violation of patents by Google.
Confidence in the first President elected independently in Egypt
Mohamed Morsi has taken oath of office, but his victory day hardly ended the political struggle in Egypt.
"Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a" "new Egypt" "while taking oath as the country's first independently elected president to replace ousted Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago."
On his formal establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the first independent elected Islamic President of the Arab world, and the fifth Head of State of Egypt after the removal of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office on his chair in front of 18 judges with black coats of the court on the banks of the Nile, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
"" "We aspire for a better future, a new Egypt and another republic," "Morsi said at a formal ceremony on national television."
"Morsi, 60, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the party's U.S., said that" "today the Egyptians have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability." ""
Hundreds of soldiers and police escorted the building and Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 am local time.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new President, leaving their motorized convoy on a generally busy road, connecting the city centre to its southern suburbs.
"Morsi's personal reputation as a" "empty tyre" "ridiculed by the Brotherhood increased significantly after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamic but also as a candidate of all those who wanted to complete the 2011 revolution against the dictatorial Mubarak."
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi administered the oath of office to the judges sitting in the wooden panel chamber, saying Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation today.
He then moved to the University of Morsi Cairo, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was accorded an official welcome by the military band by playing the national tune, while he was standing in the garb of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
"On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed with the slogan" "Army and people are one hand." ""
Established in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a hub of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath at Tahrir Square, the starting point of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and took an oath to withdraw the Presidents powers snatched from the military council from the leader who was removed last year.
But by agreeing to take official oath before the Court instead of formally taking the competent oath of Parliament, they bowed to the will of the Army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases the US spy has crossed the limit.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.

But in some cases, inappropriate methods have been adopted in an attempt to get information.
Meanwhile, an important Congressional committee has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The objective is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the confidence among the people which has been hurt by the large scale phone tapping.
Six US companies, including Google and Yahoo, have welcomed the move.
The NSA has also breached the data centres of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Foreign Intelligence (FISA) on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence (FIA) Amendment Bill [FISA) on the NSA by four votes over 11 votes.
The Bill provides for a number of restrictions including a ban on tapping a lump sum phone under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, deliberate and unauthorized collection of data, its use shall be treated as a crime and imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years.
The Bill will become law after the Rajya Sabha clears it.
"" "The NSA's phone recording programme is under the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country," "said committee chairman and Senator Diane Festival."
However, more transparency should be brought in.
At the same time, the safety of public privacy should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported the bill.
In a letter to the Senators, the companies said, We welcome this proposal of the MPs who have curbed large scale phone recording of NSA.
It may be recalled that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden have been removed from the duties of the NSA.
There has been considerable resentment in the international community after the NSA revealed monitoring of telephonic conversations of Heads of State and Government of 35 countries, including Germany and France.

A recent media report has said that the NSA sought information from data centres of Yahoo and Google for espionage.
The Washington Post has disclosed this on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's programme was called Muscular, which it ran in collaboration with its British Counter Part-GCHQ.
Both the agencies stole data passing through Yahoo and Googles vast fibre optic cable network.
The Washington Post quoted a top secret document on January 9, 2013, as saying that more than 180 million documents were collected in just three days of the start of the programme.
These include emails, text, audio and video messages.
The program was conducted outside the US and a benami telecommunications provider helped the NSA reach out to this information, the Washington Post reported.
According to the newspaper, running the program outside the US was easier for the NSA as court orders were required for such operations in the US.
"" "As far as I know, this has never happened," "NSA Chief General Keith Alexander said at a press conference in Washington."
NSA has always collected all the information within the ambit of law.
The NSA had recently targeted the German Chancellor over espionage.

Schools seek greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one Shakespeares play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
"To encourage more and more reading, the exam will also include" "not seen text." ""
A joint English literature and language course will be abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take a separate GCSE in language, and there will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow both these will be the first subjects to bring about revolutionary changes.
It will also transform other key themes next year.
At a different step, the examination regulators will showcase the changes taking place in the structure of GCSE with a new grading system, and low curriculum.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove had said that there was a lot of consensus that we need to improve our testing system to restore the confidence of the people.
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics 116 hours in a year or 3 hours less in a week during the session than most countries.
As compared, Australian schools on an average provide 143 hours in a year to students, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there would be no formal need to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that integration of comprehensive mathematics with subjects in the GCSE-League table was likely to encourage additional teaching in schools.
"The course will focus more on" "real world problems" "including financial mathematics."

Faced with opposition questions at the railway gate, Pawan Bansal put the opposition in a dilemma by saying that he did not look at anyone's woman in the last 15 years.
Everyone was surprised of this.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Later, turning the matter aside, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to lodge a complaint by putting a woman behind him during the last parliamentary elections which could not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said he had been questioned by the CBI in the railway bribery case.
If they were made witnesses in the case, would they have been made only after a thorough investigation?
Bansal said he had written a letter to only one needy person in the booth scam he was talking about.
If this is their crime, they will continue to commit such crimes.
He said though the corporation did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as development works are concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development works.
These people cannot even think about the way Chandigarh is being developed or going to be.
The two sides exchanged greetings in the Cabinet meeting.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister for his speech in response to an attack on Narendra Modi at the Chintan camp.
He also said that he has no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges need to be addressed.
The Chief Minister also had the same feeling that he took Singhs speech positively.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to honour the workers at the Chintan camp and protect them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
He, however, had also said that he was ready to sack the Cabinet to speak on the issue.
However, after the opinion that emerged in the Chintan camp, there is a possibility of a fresh consideration of the sitting of the workers in government posts.
At the camp, state JD (U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of the workers in the 20-point committees would be announced soon.
He also indicated that the list was almost ready.
Now it is reported that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will inspect the list from his own level.
They will also examine whether the views of MLAs and MPs have been taken in making the list.
The list will be extensively revamped to accommodate old and committed workers, if required.
The MLAs and MPs have alleged that their views were not taken in preparing the list of nominations.
Names of people who came much later from other parties have been included in the list, while many important activists who have been active since the days of Samta Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spun, some make life an ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person is late Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, was born on December 28, 1932, in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat.
Dhirubhai was third among five siblings.
The family has five children, Ramaniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters, Trilochan and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to drop out of school only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the house financially at an early age.
At that time he used to set up Bhajya shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
In 1949, at the age of 17, he arrived in Aden, Yemen on a ship called Cabota.
His elder brother Ramaniklal had made all arrangements for him here, so he had no problem getting jobs abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai 's mind.
So he returned to India in 1954.
In 1955, he moved to Mumbai to try his luck by putting Rs 500 in his pocket.
And this is where his business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such a step that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in India but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on 6 July 2002.
At present, he owned Rs. 62000 crore.
His sons, Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani, are currently in power.
Today, like their father, these two brothers are also among the international businessmen.
Who doesnt know the Ambani family today?
He is survived by his wife Nita Ambani, sons Akash Ambani, Anant Ambani and daughter Isha Ambani.

SRINAGAR: Police have reportedly withdrawn the security cover of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security has been withdrawn due to political reasons.
Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the election in 2002 on a PDP ticket from Shopian in the year, was part of his cabinet as Chief Minister.
I have been receiving security cover since 1996.
I live in Shopian, also known as the stronghold of terrorists.
A security team of CRPF was deployed at my house under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
I also have a bodyguard, but on Thursday, all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security team was leaving my house, I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted, Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, Abdul Ghani Mir, denied the details of the matter and said it was a sensitive matter.
I myself will examine how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been withdrawn.
State Congress chief Saifuddin Soz said, I have no such information.
If Hasan Khan's security has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am in Jammu at present and coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore in the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Rather, contrary to Modis claims, there was a time during Atal Bihari Vajpayees tenure as Prime Minister during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004) when no advertisement was issued by the government on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone of the 182-metre statue of Sardar Patel at Kevadia in Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, Earlier there was no advertisement on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
The DAVP records show that the UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When asked about Modis claims, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said the BJP's PM candidates do not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
This was due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patels advertisements is much less than the amount spent every year on the birth and death anniversaries of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore on print advertisements for Mahatma Gandhi's birth and death anniversary, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
"When asked about the difference, Manish Tewari said," "This should not be looked at from the point of view of expenditure on advertising."
Because the price of the advertisement depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of the advertisement for that year etc.
The fact is that this shows our dedication, which the opponents are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
Today, he will meet the families of those who lost their lives at a rally in Patna last Sunday.
Tight security arrangements have been made in view of PM Narendra Modi's visit.
Police carried out a thorough investigation of the route and meeting places of Modi's visit.
Police will look into the matter.
The security cover of Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and State Police will be monitored.
Modi's security will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions are also being raised about the BJP's bust Kalash Yatra over the people killed in the Patna blast.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar blamed the BJP for inciting violence.
Moving forward through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr.Georges Well is delivering free health services in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not many doctors in West African countries, there is only one doctor for 5000 people
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or anyone in the other top 10 to make CNN the hero of the year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Well had seen his ailing father come to his senses and go to the hospital, unconscious, who were not adequately equipped to help him.
Jamel Wale was injured in a car accident near the Cameroon capital Yonde in 1981.
Initially, his hands were only broken, but there was an infection that spread to his brain, and he developed blood cancer, which affected his rest of his life.
"" "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Vale, with his father, visited highly crowded clinics and hospitals and received whatever treatment he could receive.
Its not easy, he said.
You leave home at 5 am in the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but that does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can die while waiting.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Wale's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5000 persons.
In comparison, there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameroon cannot afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly two-thirds of the healthcare expenditure in the country is in the private sector.
Their only problem is poverty.
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Vel resolved to find some solution.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Yonde.
And he launched the non-profit organization Escowim, which goes to rural areas over the weekend to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle from rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they actually get the respect of heroes: dinner, singing and dance, and the best accommodation to be offered by the community.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and well - with its great smile and endless energy - it involves happiness.
The next morning his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
"" "We are meeting 500 people every journey."
They come from a distance of about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All these clinics provide a variety of medical services over the weekend.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get Baisakhi, donated glasses or free birth certificate -- this document is required in the school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgeries with spatial anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in school buildings, town halls or homes, after the process, the patient walks to the recovery site, and creates space for the next person.
The group's generator publishes operating rooms and sanitising equipment, and Vale and his volunteers wake up early on Sunday morning.
This is a rough speed, but the village musicians generally help keep the team motivated.
"" "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and keep our work going."
Their team returns to the city on Sunday, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group - including Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students - has performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their support can change the world of those they help.
One person said that he will be able to go back to work due to free hernia surgery.
"" "This will change the future of me and my family."
Apart from running the weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Vale also works in a private medical clinic around the compound at night.
He said that this is his second job which provides finance to 60% of his non-profit work and the rest is completed by private donations.
"" "I don't know when they sleep," "said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at the University of Druckcell in Philadelphia and volunteer in the Well group."
They are always in the hospital, or trying to earn money for their organization, so that they continue to run these campaigns.
This is a pilot opportunity for medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join the Welsh campaign, which they can never achieve in their own country.
"" "In the surgery that we help Dr. Vale catch tools or clean blood stains, we have been able to gain experimental experience," "O'Malley said."
As a second-year medical student in the United States, you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend on their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come with charity medical supplies.
But after the arrival of the eunuchs, their stay, and the expenses of the instructions are borne by the well.
"" "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For Well, the burden of almost the same work is not the difficulty.
Helping others lead a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that make them very happy.
"" "I am very happy to do this work."
And I think of my father.
I hope they will be watching what I am doing.
I am doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.
Visit the website of Escowim and find out how to help.
You might not believe it but it is true.

Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs an answer from Modi.
It is your duty to answer the people.

Obamas healthcare proposal withdrawn
"Amid criticism, President Obama yesterday withdrew his frequent repeated misleading promise that" "you can continue if you like your health plan." ""
Along with millions of people receiving cancellation information from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the President for misleading American citizens in recent days.
Yesterday Obama changed his real message.
"In a speech in Boston, he said," "A lot of people who have health insurance, and that is useful, can continue to do so."
"Addressing what he calls the" "storm of news," "Obama has favoured buying new coverage in the market from American citizens receiving these information."
Most people will be able to get a better deal, the same amount of money or a comprehensive healthcare scheme cheaper than the proposed one.
"" "You will get a better deal."
The administration has said that it should not be surprising that 5% of the population who buy insurance from their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage is not in line with the desired standards under the Viability Care Act.
"In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said," "I tell these American citizens directly," "you deserve better."
"Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the affordable care Act, said the online market launch since October has been" "unfortunate." ""
I am as disappointed and angry as others do, he said.
I want to regain your confidence.
To a colleague sitting behind him in the House hearing yesterday after a bitter scuffle with the Republicans, Sebelius angrily said the sentence, which was caught by a Mike. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.

As the election code of conduct came into force, there were cases of violations.
There were more complaints in the initial days, but gradually it has started decreasing.

Many parties were campaigning like before due to lack of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.
Political parties are following the model code of conduct along with getting information about it.

"In an unexpected admission, John Kerry said the U.S. spy has" "unfairly advanced" ""
"John Kerry has indicated that the US 'protective attitude on his surveillance program has softened by accepting it as unexpected that its spy" "goes unfairly far." ""
"The Minister has also admitted that he along with Barack Obama is also guilty of being an" "automated pilot" "as a rebellious revelation to spokesman Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities."
This revelation has brought a diplomatic earthquake to the U.S. government in relation to its allies.
Speaking through video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: There is no question that the President, I, and others in the Government were really aware of some of the things that happened to the automatic pilot, because back to the difficult years of World War II, and the Cold War, and then, of course, 9 / 11.
He has become the first high-level member of the U.S. government to recognize that the US spy has crossed its borders, but has insisted that no one's rights have been misused.
"He said:" "In some cases, it has gone far beyond unreasonably."
And the President is determined to try to make this clear to the people and is currently conducting a thorough review so that no one is subjected to abuse.
I assure you that nothing is going wrong with the innocent in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that however, the NSA was working for a good cause, and its monitoring has saved many lives.
"" "We are facing a world where people are ready to fly themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people and attacking governments.
So what is the problem if you are able to stop it before it happens?
We have saved the aircraft from actually falling, demolishing buildings, and killing people as we have been able to know in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs said that U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to help address concerns abroad about the so-called US espionage, and try to convince European countries about the need to continue their anti-corruption efforts jointly with the US.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about the threats to his involvement in counter-terrorism organisations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"" "For U.S. national security interests, it is really important that European countries be with us in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts," "Murphy, who was elected for the first time of the Democratic Party and President of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on European Affairs, told Washington."
To make it clear to the European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA programme.
Reports of the NSA recording millions of European phone conversations have brought bitterness in relations with some of the US allies, though the head of the agency said that these reports are not entirely correct, and reflect the misconception of the metadata collected by NATO allies with the United Nations.
Other disclosures in the documents leaked by Snowden reveal that the NSA has monitored cell phones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the espionage incident on associate countries, calling it necessary and said it was common for both sides to do so.
Amidst the ruckus, Murphy said his office was arranging a Congress visit which is likely to be held this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both the parties and both the Chambers.
The names of other participating law makers will be released in the coming days.
He said work on the Yatra programme is still going on.
"While Murphy said the purpose of the visit was to improve relations, he said some" "impractical relationships" "had to be abandoned."
He said European leaders along with their people will also have to be honest with their spy programs used over the years.
"" "Although we can revise our surveillance programme to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," "Murphy said."
Meanwhile, this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will address hatred from the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran to the US surveillance activities.
A new politics of Board Change has begun in the Municipalities.
Recently, the Congress-led board in Sainthia Municipality in Birbhum district was converted into the TMC board due to the change of party of councillors.
The transformation took place as most of the Congress councillors, including the Municipal Chairman, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors of the CPI (M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also joined the TMC.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy considers this as a good sign for the party.
He said 10 Congress councillors, including Sainthia Municipal Corporation Chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, joined the TMC.
Some Left Front councillors, including the CPI (M), have also unfurled the TMC flag.
All have informed the District Magistrate in writing under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the TMC and according to the numbers force, the Sainthia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the TMC.
Shri Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the roadmap for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, CPI (M), CPI, and Forward Bloc are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
Qualified leaders of any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
The Trinamool occupation of the municipal board is considered important in political circles due to the change of party of Congress councillors in Sainthia Municipality ahead of the November 22 municipal elections.
Earlier, the Left Front ruled Haldia and Nadia also had an example of the Trinamool occupying the Congress-ruled Municipal Board.
When the TMC takes over the municipal board in the districts due to defection of the party, those who join the party are accorded a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to break away from other parties and join the TMC.
He said those who have broken away from any party are welcome to the TMC.
He claimed that the faith of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing as a result of which people want to join the TMC.
However, the main opposition CPI (M) says low level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress fearing terror.
The CPI (M) is terming the change in the board of elected local bodies as a blow to democracy.
In a democratic manner, any party has the right to expand its base, but the justification for a change of opinion on the subject of power is bound to be questioned.
Australian woman appeals against Thai prison term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Fucket for wrongly accusing a taxi driver of assaulting her and has appealed against the decision and got bail.
On June 15, the Fucket provincial court found Steve Rochelle Bomford guilty of levelling false allegations against the Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver, along with two other persons, tried to stop him on Sunday morning.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned to the hotel safely after separation from her Australian boyfriend.
When the Fucket police questioned Bamfort for two days, he admitted to fabricating the story.
He was kept in the local police custody before the hearing in the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Fucket rather than an adult female prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunx, who has requested the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help her daughter.
"Tunx told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was" "deeply concerned" "about the care of their daughter and wanted to call her back to Australia."
"" "It has undoubtedly been a worrying time for us, but we hope he will be back home as soon as possible."
Bamford has appealed against the sentencing order, and has been granted bail at 50,000.
In Australia, the report said she was holidaying at the Kraby holiday site in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in Fucket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend its sentence to two years and compel him to stay in the adult prison.
Similarly, after the recent killing of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Fucket, Thailand can also be exonerated in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
Taking a dig at Bishnoi, the MP said that one day bursting of pictures at the house of a particular community does not serve the welfare of the poor.
