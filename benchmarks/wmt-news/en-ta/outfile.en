Why did Queen make mistake in delaying Parliament: Joyce McMillan
Long ago, once I had some contact with the people of the Committee Buckingham Palace, not with the royal family, but with a small group of senior officials.
Even 20 years later, on July 1, 1999, I think it is a crime to say exactly what they said about the role of the Queen in the plan to formally open the new Parliament of Scotland: but more precisely, through their vast experience throughout the Commonwealth, political autonomy is different and the role of the King as the head of the country is different.
Amidst the provocation, anger and outcry of the recent shocking chapter of the Brexit crisis in Britain, a question remains etched in my mind: To get the Queen's approval for the Prime Minister's proposal to rarely postpone Parliament for five weeks, what exactly happened on August 28, when Queen usually becomes Lord President of the Council to Balmorol, which is late in the summer.
"11 This is indeed a small part of the Prime Minister's drama" "fake" "on Wednesday night when he dismissed the verdict of the Supreme Court judges as" "wrong" "and instigated a spirit of war, using the words" "surrender" "and" "betrayal" "in relation to Brexit, receiving numerous letters of protest daily from female parliamentarians and his colleagues, who were killed as" "false" "the fear of their own safety."
However, this is a small part that can be said to be a play of the same person, and so far it has not been a happy and reassuring sight to see 13 Prime Ministers and no doubt to be an old woman who is extremely intelligent and rational beyond the 14th Prime Minister.
The fact is that on that day, during their 67 years of rule, the Queen and her advisers seem to have made a almost entirely wrong decision so far, which David Cameron mentioned in his memoir is more serious than his intervention in the Scottish independence vote, in which people only say, 'think carefully' before they vote, saying that there should be only a trade unionist who has not changed their faith.
However, as soon as the new Prime Minister proposes such a long delay before the Brexit deadline this time, the couple must have been warned that a couple of quick calls from the palace to the Prime Minister's residence would have been sufficient to convince the Prime Minister to reduce the pre-speech postponement to a few days or a week.
As far as palace dwellers are concerned, 99 per cent of the old customs and procedures are legal.
So what went wrong?
We may never, or we may not know for decades.
No matter how small the outcome of the vote may have been, the Queen and her advisers may have thought that a new government should not ban its implementation.
During a holiday in which many important people could not have been there, Johnson and Reese Mac may have unexpectedly silenced the Queen.
Or perhaps, as some republics say, as a wise and moderate queen who always thinks of the welfare of her people, the queen may have thought of being loyal to the queen, who would unhesitatingly help the right-wing government, if pressured to weaken Scotland, Britain or the European state, who would hide the palace and traditional privileges and threaten the traditional authority.
It has been 42 years since the Queen was angrily associated with the fascist regime, the role of the Sex Pistols Committee with the poet John Lay.
Whatever the role of the Queen in the postponement, it is clear that the current Brexit problem has succeeded in undermining the importance of the Queen's traditional role in stabilizing the Constitution of Britain by examining the unwritten constitution to its extent, prompting a dangerous moment for an open constitutional power war between the government, parliament and the courts, as declared by a government that does not have a majority in Parliament, in conjunction with an act declared to be illegal.
In just a short span of three years in one of the most stable democracies in the world, the Putin, the drunkards, and their forces with hateful web pods must have been happy about the significant progress of their plan in a world's most stable democracy.
To consider its position on the United Kingdom, which has completely changed by Brexit, Scotland, which is not the prime target of destabilizing this instability, must now be given a second chance soon.
In 1977, Lytton and Sex Pistols had given a famous warning that you do not have a future in England's dream.
However, now, England's aggressive dream of a better past shaped by 21st century lies and dreams begins to shape the future of all of us on these islands As long as we find our own ways, we all have to live in that dream country or in a terrible country, we have to live with the queen, without the queen, inside or outside the United Kingdom, we have to fight lies, we have to embrace the reality of our lives together, we have to accept the reality of the 21st century together as citizens.
How much was Kelvi Fletcher paid for the Strictly show, who was his wife, and why did he leave Emerdel?
Former Emmerdale actor Kelville Fletcher changed Tales for Dance Floor in BBC's Strictly Com Dance 2019.
But what do we know about him?
How much was Kelvin Fletcher paid for the Strictly Come Dancing program?
As the father of a child, he is said to have been paid a salary between 25,000 and 40,000 for the 17th season of Strictly Com dancing.
The Sun had previously stated that each celebrity would be paid 25,000 online.
Till the end of October, the fee will increase to 40,000.
60,000 will be given to those who qualify for the quarterfinals, which will significantly increase his salary.
Since Kelvin is a great competitor, if he wins the entire competition, he will have all the opportunities to win the 100,000 prize.
Why did Kelvin Fletcher leave us?
Kelvin joined Emerdel in 1996 when he was six years old at his youngest age.
For good reason, she played the role for 20 years until she exited the role of Andy Chakton in 2016.
Speaking on the occasion, the actor spoke about his decision to quit the ITV soap show.
Speaking to Emman Holmes and Ruth Langford, the host, said: Twenty years is a long time.
These two decades are also amazing.
I am very grateful to you.
There was a sense of satisfaction and vision throughout that period.
It started as an entertainment at the age of six - I was able to do so on a daily professional platform in one of the biggest events of the country that day.
Im very lucky.
Looking back over the last 20 years, it has made a lot of changes, and for me it has given me the desire to leave and continue.
The Security Council was told that African cooperation for peace is' growing '.
During the speech of the Senior Secretary General of the United Nations, Maria Luis Ribeiro Vyatti, the Security Council on Thursday heard that African countries were building growing strong bonds to advance peace and security and sustainable inclusive progress across the continent.
Acknowledging the success of the African Union and member states in achieving key milestones in their efforts for high performance, self-reliance and cooperation, Vyati welcomed the work of the African Union Mediation Support Unit in Conflict Prevention and Mediation and the Femweiss Network of African Women.
Transparent progress at the regional and national level
The peace talks initiated by the African Union led to a political agreement overseen by the United Nations in the Central African Republic.
Referring to the visits made by the United Nations Office for West Africa to various countries ahead of the assembly or presidential elections in the last two years, Viti said the cooperation between the United Nations, the African Union and other members is growing in terms of the election.
He continued that the United Nations and the African Union are closely cooperating to ensure that the views of women and youth are essential for peace process and both organizations have young ambassadors and tactics to act as ambassadors and agents of change.
We need more effective support from the international community
Despite many examples of progress, Vyatti declared that the international community needed to do more to support Africas efforts.
For example, the peace measures initiated by the African Union require more predictable, flexible and stable funding, more political commitment to peace and sustainable peace efforts, and active support for the African Union's initiative to calm guns.
There is a need for foresight and determination to build cooperation and channelize their energies, 'the General Secretary said, adding that he looks forward to greater cooperation and cooperation to enable the African Union to achieve its goal of equitable, people-centric change and sustainable peace and security by 2063.
Belfast High Court Dismisses Brexit Case
An appeal court in Belfast has dismissed a case seeking an order that the United States government's Brexit policy would affect the peace process in Northern Ireland.
The three petitioners filed an appeal after the Belfast High Court ruling rejected their plea challenging the manner in which the United States government was handling the practice in BRICS.
One of the applicants was Raymond McCardt, who campaigned for the high ranking victims, whose son was killed by the loyal forces in 1997.
This comes in the wake of a unanimous verdict by the United Nations Supreme Court that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully by closing Parliament for five weeks.
The case was heard by a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India Sir Teklan Morgan.
On 31st October, the three focused on various aspects of non-contractual Brexit.
One of the arguments that the government's Brexit policy would affect the peace process in Northern Ireland were earlier rejected by the High Court.
During the hearing of the appeal last week, Mr McCart's lawyer, Renan Levy, told the Cuban Court that if the government was unable to get the Brexit extension in the absence of an agreement, the normal status was to put an end to the Brexit process by withdrawing Section 50 and not to leave without agreement.
Mr. McCardt, who did not come to the court due to ill health, said that he would review the Belfast Appellate Court verdict along with his lawyer.
"I think it will affect peace with many others." ""
I hope my confidence is misplaced.
We have not filed a case to warn the people, this is something I believe.
"People will come to me in the future." ""
It has not affected the peace process.
I dont want it to affect peace.
I do not want others to experience what my family and other family members have experienced.
I fully respect the verdict of the Appellate Court and I believe that the judges there are the best judges in the United Kingdom.
I respect their verdict.
However, I am afraid that peace will be affected.
Number of women in science is not satisfactory: President Kovind
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, said that the participation of women in the field of science in the country is not satisfactory and steps should be taken to ensure better participation of women in the field.
In his address at the 78th Foundation Day celebrations of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, he said that if the contribution of students and women in the field of science and technology is high, the achievements in that field will be better and more desirable.
In this regard, the names of Mission Director M Vanitha and Project Director Ritu Karidal are being pronounced in all the houses, he said.
We must take necessary steps to ensure increased participation of students and women in the field of science and technology.
When this happens, our scientific achievements will be even more beneficial and desirable, the President said.
None of our successes will make sense without equal opportunities for our daughters, he added
Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India K Vijayaraghavan and CSIR Director General Shekhar Mande were also present on the occasion.
Shri Kovind called upon the scientific community to be prepared for the grave danger.
It is in this that there is actually a possibility of developing transformative technologies and innovations, he added.
He said that education, science institutions, industry and entrepreneurs must collaborate to ensure that scientific research can be taken from laboratories to industry, agriculture, incubation centres and new industries.
Shri Bardhan presented the fuel nuclear model developed by CSIR laboratories to the President.
This is the first model made in India and fuel cells use hydrogen to generate electricity.
The Joker is shocking, scary and shocking
Joaquin Phoenix has given him a worthy performance at the Oscars as a comic book villain, the villain's energy was once in his vague myths, but due to his courageous deep search to know about his appearance, the energy has now improved with Joker.
It is dangerous to try to act as a Joker, but that is what has given the best results here, as Phoenix's performance in the role, which has been portrayed by various actors in different ways, is unique and surprising, as the story is half true and surrounds the city of the real world.
What we see on screen is shocking, frightening, motivating us to see fully, stimulating anxiety, preventing sleep, and shocking.
The film has successfully done a very difficult job of sympathizing with Arthur Fleck, who thinks he is a stand-up comedian, and does not give much importance to this aspect.
Equal stabilization is truly impressive.
Phoenix gives the best performance of the year, but Dinero has once again shown his mettle in his work, in which his involvement concentrates the Scorsese gaps that are scattered all over the film.
This is not a comic book film, even though it has been published for some details about Batman, it is completely unique, that is why it is so good that it is not a form, not a custom and there are no laws.
You may be unhappy for some time after the film is over, but it deserves different dreams that will continue to come.
This is the first time that Saudi Arabia has issued a tourist visa by repealing the Abeya Act.
At present, only foreign workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims are being provided in Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia on Friday said it was for the first time that it had issued tourist visas, and as part of its efforts to increase its economy other than oil, the most conservative country has been opened to holiday enthusiasts.
The development of tourism plays an important role in Prince Mohammed bin Salmans 2030 reform plan to prepare Arabias largest economy for the post-oil era.
The announcement comes just two weeks after Washington blamed Iran and threatened to disrupt global fuel markets and create fear of widespread regional conflicts over Saudi Arabias oil infrastructure.
Opening the doors of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment in our country, 'said Ahmed al-Katib, Head of Tourism.
Tourists will be surprised to see our treasures five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and a magnificent natural beauty.
Saudi Arabia will open its application for online tourist visas for citizens of 49 countries on Saturday, Bloomberg News reported.
Katib said that the Kingdom will ease the clothing restrictions for foreign women and allow Saudi women to leave the Abaiya tank, which still has to be worn while going out.
However, he added that foreign women should wear dignified clothes without elaborating on it.
Visas to this desert kingdom, which is full of traditional and ancient sites of Pedo, are now being issued only to foreign workers, their dependents and Muslim travellers visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
As a rare event, Saudi Arabia started issuing temporary visas to visitors participating in sports and cultural events in an effort to promote tourism last year.
But many people believe that this conservative kingdom with strict social norms, which prohibits alcohol consumption, does not worry much of the tourists.
Prince Mohammed is trying to change this by bringing new films, two gender concerts and big sporting events to Saudi Arabia through a complete liberalization effort.
Audiences say that the international criticism of the human rights record of the state, including the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, who criticised him last year, and the actions on women's rights activists, will prevent foreign travellers from coming.
The fear of regional conflicts after the September 14 attacks on Aramco, the country's largest oil company, could also make the words of the Kingdom unheard of the tourists.
The Government, which is recovering from low oil prices, expects the tourism sector to contribute from the current 3% to 10% of the countrys GDP by 2030
It aims to attract 100 million viewers annually as domestic and foreign tourists by 2030.
However, while officials estimate that 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required across the country in the coming decade, the state does not have the infrastructure to accommodate such a large number of passengers.
Faced with a large number of unemployed youth, the government said it expects the industry to create one million tourism jobs.
Saudi Arabia has raised billions to start the tourism industry from the very beginning.
The Kingdom announced a multi-billion project in 2017 to convert 50 islands and holy sites in the Red Sea into luxury hotels.
Last year, the construction of eight high quality theme parks, motorsports facilities and the entertainment city of Gudiya in a Safari area began near Riyadh.
The country is also developing historical sites like the multi-century old Mada'in Salle, which is the site of the sandstone tombs of the same civilization that created the Jordanian city of Petra.
Wells Fargo to appoint Charles Sharf as CEO of BNY Mellen
Charles Sharfey, a senior banker, announced on Friday that Wells Fargo was its CEO, the third CEO of the company, since a series of corruption emerged three years ago.
Sharf took over from interim CEO Alan Barker when the former CEO suddenly resigned.
Sloane said that increasing pressure from politicians and regulatory bodies to run the bank that has been affected by corruption is an obstacle.
Sharf will also take charge in a situation where he is under the supervision of the regulatory body and is recovering from the taint of his reputation following corruption.
The internal and regulatory investigations conducted since the emergence of corruption have exposed other problems in each of the banks core industries, exposing penalties, penalties, spending millions of dollars, and the Federal Reserve has to face unprecedented restrictions on its stock position.
Since 2016, more than half of the independent directors of the Wells Fargo Group have joined them, the group has been changed several times since corruption emerged.
Very recently, Sharf was the President of the New York Mellon (BKN) Bank.
Prior to joining the bank, he was heading Visa Inc. (VN), the world's largest payment network.
On another occasion, BNY Mellan declared Finance Minister Thomas Gippens as its interim CEO.
The bank further said that Sharf has given up all his shares and incentives which were not paid as of Thursday.
As Sharf worked only for two years at the New York Mellon Bank, it is not certain what to expect from Sharf as Wells Fargo CEO, said CPW researcher Brian Kleinansal.
"" "The first task of Sharfin will be to reconcile the regulatory bodies and make necessary changes to remove the existing asset control," "Kleinansal said."
Sharf, 54, started his career in 1987 with Commercial Credit Corporation, a consumer finance company run by Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weil, heads of the two largest banks in the United States.
According to the newspaper of former students of NYU Stern Industrial School, he was declared an assistant to Dimon within six months of joining the commercial credit company.
Wels Fargo said in a statement that Sharf will start his new work next month.
"Wells comes from a bank with less retail than Fargo, so he will have to learn a lot," "said Eric Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Rose Industrial School."
In June, Reuters reported that a group of lenders had considered keeping the park as a permanent CEO even after they said they would appoint an outsider for the post of CEO.
Sharfin's basic salary in the bank will be $2.5 million, which is almost the same amount as Sloan's basic salary in 2018.
In BNY, the regulatory implications showed that Sharfin's overall salary for the year 2018 was $9.4 million.
Sloan's total salary for that year was $18.4 million.
Shares of Wells Fargo rose nearly 3.2% to $50.44 in the booking trade.

CBI arrests parents in Nova Quattro's mysterious death
Los Angeles: Officials confirmed on Thursday that the parents of a 4-year-old boy, Noah Quattro, who died in Baltel under suspicious circumstances in July, were arrested.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff Department announced that Jose Quattro and Ursula Warnes were arrested on September 26, 2019, at around 8.00 am, for killing their son Noah.
The two were charged at Bamdel Sheriff's station and served a warrant to search for them at their home to seize any additional evidence related to Noahs death.
In May, the court had ordered that Noah be banished from the care of his parents, claiming to be being tortured.
According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff, he was expelled from his home and not taken to care of the upbringing, and on July 5, Nova's parents called 911 and told him that he was drowning in a pond in an apartment in Block NO. 1200 in East Avenue
Noah was taken to a local hospital in an ambulance.
He died the next morning, July 6.
On seeing the signs of shock in Noahs body, they decided that there was doubt in the parents explanation of the cause of death.
Since then, all three of Noahs siblings have been evicted from the house and the Sharif department has started an investigation.
TCFS has earlier conducted several investigations into domestic violence in Nova.
Noah's maternal grandmother, Eva Hernands, told the CBSLA that she had been going and coming into nurturing her entire life.
"" "The hands of DCFS have been contaminated," "said Brian Cleibool, a lawyer for Hernandez."
Even though we are talking about the arrest of his parents today, we are going to show the organization the reason for the death of this boy in the coming days.
In 2016, according to the Times, Noah was evicted from his home and kept in nursery for two years.
In November 2018, he was again transferred to the care of his parents.
Hernandez said that he often cared for his great-grandson.
"He asked me," "Grandma, I'm here, don't send me back," "said Hernandez."
It is difficult for me to remember every word he said to me.
Each of Noahs parents has come on a billion bond and must go to court on September and Monday.
Rugby World Cup 2019: Warren Cdland announces Wales squad for tournament against Australia
Warren Cdland has announced that there will be no change in the Wales squad for the D category match against Australia, and when Allan Win Jones leads his team in Tokyo, he will become the most competitive player in the country.
The Wales captain will be playing his 130th match, breaking the previous record held by Kevin Jenkins.
Although central players Headley Barks and Hooker Ken Owens had scored, Cedland had put his confidence in the first-round team, who had won 43-14 against Georgia four days ago.
There is a change in the replacement as central player Owen Watkin replaces Lei Huffen.
Scotland had nine players in their squad when Wales won the match against Wallace in November last year.
After the Rugby World Cup debut in Georgia, there are more opportunities for Prov Win Jones and Franger Aaron Weinright.
Flying Lux Jack Paul and Allan Win Jones will again be the second row bench cover for Finger Aaron Schingler.
The first team will be decided in Group D at the Tokyo Stadium on Sunday, where the winner will take on France or Argentina in the quarterfinal.
If Australia win this match, it will be the 14th time in the last 15 matches between the two teams, in which case Scotland will face England in the last eight matches.
Buy a quality Guardian photo: David Levin Myanmar
In 2016, Guardian photographer David Levin and architectural critic Oliver Weinright went there to document the changing city of Yangon, amidst major political changes and foreign investments.
Its crumbling British cultural architecture, especially street life, was a source of many stories and films.

Canada captain says helping show their strengths in the World Cup will help improve the team
"" "Canada rugby captain Tyler Artron said that he had no misconception about how important the task before his team was in the next two World Cup matches, but that it would help his team to" "" "show their strength" "" "in the long run to improve their team." ""
The North Americans, who were beaten 48-7 by Italy in their first Group B match at the Fukuoka Hagtanomori Stadium, are now facing world champions New Zealand three times on October 2 before Cobil faced South Africa on October 8.
Artron, who plays for the New Zealand club Vegado Cheap in the International Super Rugby, is one of the few Canadian players to play in first-class cricket and admitted that he had no chance to shock any of those South African countries.
"We are playing in the World Cup to play against the best teams (and)... we are not likely to win this match (against Italy), the goals we scored showed," "Artran said."
We have to show our proud performance (against New Zealand).
It is an opportunity for many players to showcase their talent and some of them can expect to showcase their amazing talent and get a contract.
That is our success.
Like Uruguay's win over Fiji in Kamaishi on Wednesday, runners-up may have fewer and far away wins.
However, the Italian team, which was not ready to get the second shock within 24 hours, showed the benefit of having full time professional players usually playing Test matches.
However, Canada coach Kingsley Jones said that the way his team played on Thursday, which had been stuck for years internationally and had qualified for the tournament for the last time, was an important one.
Major League Rugby (MLR), which was launched two years ago in North America, is an important step towards bridging the gap between first-class and second-class team countries and the progress of players in Canada and the United States.
When I came to Canada, I realized the reality of how difficult it was to bring together the players.
"They all had work during the day," "Jones said."
But I think the MLA gave life to Canada and the US.
It paved the way for players and coaches.
Jones said 51 Canadian players had been signed by MLR clubs last season.
More than 18 months ago, more than 40 people were doing other work
This is a big step in the right direction, he said.
MLAs still have to go a long way.
It is still in initial stage but one way to definitely go to the first level.
I am confident that in the long run, it will definitely get faster and become a competition with the best of matches.
The Council blocks Trump's national emergency over the border and implements the house
President Donald Trump speaks during a visit to the border wall models.
The House on Friday voted to prevent a national emergency declaration used by President Donald Trump to fund the proposed border wall.
The resolution to stop Trump's operation was passed by a margin of 236-174, which was sent to the President by the Democrats.
Eleven Republicans and an independent supported it.
The move was already approved by the Senate in the ratio of 54-41 votes as 11 Republicans, along with the Democrats, supported it.
This will be Trump's sixth time that the resolution will be passed by his house or by his power, after he became President.
In March, he had already carried out the process of ending the Emergency Declaration using Homeland Security.
It does not seem that any House of Parliament has a two-thirds majority to pass beyond the Presidents opposition.
In February, Trump declared a national emergency after he failed to receive funds from both the Mexican government and parliament for the border areas on the southern border.
His administration plans to raise $3.6 billion from military construction for border projects.
The Democrats accused Trump of violating the strength of the Parliament for finance and using the most important military fund for unnecessary sanctions.
Some Republicans in both the Houses expressed concern that Trump's announcement could set an example of overthrowing power.
Some Republicans, who are scheduled to face Senate elections next year, faced intense political pressure over the national emergency vote.
Children exposed to air pollution at higher risk of death
According to a study, children living in areas with higher air pollution are at a higher risk of dying than in areas with cleaner air.
This is not the first study to study the link between air pollution and child mortality, but this study focuses on various pollutants at different levels in the lives of children.
Dr. Sarah Kodecha, a researcher at Cardiff University, said the results make it difficult for pregnant women and their families to do anything big.
"You will remain where you live, you cannot avoid pollution every day," "he added."
If you can find some ways, you can see what are the possible interventions, he said.
A growing research organization has shown that there is also a link between various components of air pollution and health problems such as lung problems, heart disease, mental health problems, dementia and low birth weight.
This recent study, which has not yet been reviewed or published by fellow researchers, will be delivered at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Madrid.
Kodecha said the study was based on data for nearly 8 million births that were born alive in the UK and Wales between 2001 and 2012.
The group divided England and Wales into 35,000 areas each consisting of about 1,500 residents, with an annual average of three pollutants, taking into account the annual mortality rate of children born within a year.
These are BM10 from burning vehicles and waste, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) from burning of image fuel and metal extraction in power stations and refineries.
The team compared the mortality rate of children in the five worst polluted areas to the best five areas.
Considering factors such as the age of the mother at birth, the extent of loss of the area and birth weight, children under one year of age living in areas with very polluted air were more likely to die than in areas with very clean air.
The results of the three pollutants showed that the risk of death was 7% for NO2, 4% for PM10 and 19% for SO2.
Further analysis showed that out of the three pollutants, only SO2 was associated with the death of a child within 28 days.
The study could not prove whether air pollution increased due to increased risk of loss of life in those areas.
It also does not take into account the levels of internal air pollution.
Professor Mirail Toledano, a paediatrician at Imperial College London, confirmed that air pollution poses a major threat to public health and that current standards fail to protect people.
The recent study contained various restrictions.
It takes into account the average pollution levels of relatively large areas, but in fact within a short distance, its measurements can be very different - which means that the amounts involved in children are not calculated.
The study did not take into account climate and climate change and factors such as where the mother was during pregnancy or the mother's smoking habit.
It is not clear how factors such as birth weight were also taken into account, Toledano said.
"This shows that air pollution poses some additional risk to the child's death, but the method it has been set up is a very comprehensive analysis," "Toledano said."
Dr. Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Pneumonia Foundation, said that steps should be taken to address the risk of public health, including the introduction of clean air areas in the most polluted cities.
Sources linking the infant mortality rate and air pollution are still emerging, but the risk of infant mortality in the most polluted cities of the United Kingdom is significantly higher, he said, adding that it should be a slap on the government.
The PM10 microscopes from transportation during pregnancy and early life of the child are associated with a slight reduction in lung function at the age of eight - even if the infection does not occur when the child is 15 years old.
Wood said that children cannot protect their lungs on their own and said that this study reflects previous inventions.
Both these studies focus on the impact of air pollution on the most vulnerable youth in our society, he said.
The Muslim woman says that the company did not employ her because she wanted to worship at work.
Shaheen Inderwala is filing a case against the company for allegedly discriminating against him.
Shaheen Inderwala, who was working with children with autism, wanted to gain more experience in marketing.
Hence, he applied to Fast Track Management, which claims to be a company in marketing in North Virginia.
When asked to use his leisure time to pray, Indurwala now files a case against the company, claiming that he was discriminated against because of his religion.
"" "In a case filed in a US provincial court on Tuesday, Indurwala said he was" "" "humiliated" "" "by the Chief Executive Officer of Fast Track Company for mocking his Muslim beliefs." ""
Chief Executive Officer Ramas Gevillando denies that Indurwala had decided not to work.
"" "The Council for US-Islamic Relations, which filed the case on behalf of Inderwala, held a small press conference outside the Falls Church office of Fast Track on Wednesday, saying the Bast Track was" "" "an institution that did not respect provincial law and did not give him a job because of his religious beliefs." ""
In a video conference, Inderwala said that his first interview was well conducted and he was asked to come for the second interview.
During the interview, Inderwala said that a deputy manager of the past track company had said that his company was providing a long meal break.
Inderwala asked if he could reduce his meal break time and instead take two to five minutes to offer prayers during the work time.
He immediately concluded the interview.
This is not possible.
He said that work hours cannot be changed here.
The case states that the deputy manager went to Gevillando with Indurwala and told him that the working hours were not suitable for Indurwala.
Indurwala said he explained to Gevillando that he was praying five times a day.
At that time, Gevillando pointed to his headscarf and made ridiculous comments about his religion, Indurwala said.
Am I being ridiculed publicly because of my religion at a place to be considered for a professional job?...
It is clear that I was discriminated against because of my religion, Indurwala said at a press conference.
Its over.
I quietly walked out of the office.
I did not want to hold any demonstration there, but I was hurt and very embarrassing.
When contacted over the phone on Thursday, Gevillando said he did not reject Inderwala's application but decided that it was Indirawala who did not need it.
One person came for an interview.
He doesn't want to work here....
This is like I go to the warehouse shop and then I dont want to eat the kit, he said.
He recalled that Inderwala had said that he was a Muslim, especially when he did not remember his request for a five-minute break in service.
He added that he was not joking about his intervention: I am not a fashion expert.
One can wear whatever one wants.
Scott Morrison will consider what Donald Trump did, but it is not possible to follow
Sometimes Morrison does not have to say that it is wrong to echo the President's voice.
"" "On Wednesday, he complained about the media for giving" "" "absolutely wrong" "" "and" "" "totally misguided" "" "information about his climate policies." ""
Therefore, there is no doubt that he will consider Trump's method of winning the next election and whether it will work in November 2020.
But political tactics will not be so easy beyond the Pacific region.
But there is a simple reason why people around Morrison do not change the Prime Minister like Trump, and the tactics of radical separation that fit the United States do not fit into a region that is decided at the centre of electoral victory or defeat.
Forced voting stops anyone who forgets what is in between and thinks of the marginalized.
There is opposition and support for Trump in Australia, so some voters may have been pushed because of his friendship with Morrison, so doing just like the President does not guarantee victory.
If the Prime Minister is changed to Trump, some leftists who criticize Trump are afraid that the world will become what they think, or they are looking at a proxy war.
Imagine Morich that way.
He will not stop with avoiding the United Nations Climate Summit.
He would call it a waste of time.
The use of his speech at the United Nations to talk about climate action shows that Morrison does not want to lose voters who expect political leaders to take it seriously.
There is a difference of opinion between the two leaders that a power has the right to give what should happen in the world.
The future is not for those who think about the world.
The future is in the hands of patriotic people, Trump said at the United Nations on Tuesday.
The use of his speech at the United Nations to talk about climate action shows that Morrison does not want to lose voters who expect political leaders to take it seriously.
What it may mean may require a long study of what it means, but the willingness of the patriots to impose on others is in conflict with Australias support for a negotiated settlement between the countries.
"We will be more secure and prosperous in a world of agreed rules than just exercising power," "Morrison told Asialink in an interview in Sydney in June."
Zimbabwe: Economic sanctions slow down the pace of progress.
Vamaida Murvira, New York, USA
President Mangawa said that the illegal and disruptive sanctions imposed by the West on Zimbabwe have greatly reduced the country's progress.
This is an attack on the rights of citizens, he said.
The President was speaking at the 74th regular session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 74).
He complimented South Africa for its firm support to Zimbabwe's demand for an unconditional removal of the two-decade-long ban.
The President said that while Zimbabwe had registered progress in providing security nets to vulnerable sections of the society, it could have achieved more had it not been for an illegal ban.
These achievements have been made possible despite the problems that have created illegal economic sanctions.
Further, restrictions reduce the pace of our progress, prevent the recovery of the economy and punish the poorest and the most vulnerable, he added.
The President said that a change is taking place in Zimbabwe, and he is determined to overcome the fact that the economy and currency have deteriorated due to illegal sanctions.
Namibia President Hugh Gainab supported Harare's demand for a clear announcement that the ban on Zimbabwe should be lifted in order to advance his economic growth plan.
President Mangakwa urged the United Nations to exercise its power and respect its policies by ordering countries to impose sanctions.
As a United Nations, we will bravely respect the principles of our Charter
The mistakes of the world must be corrected.
Unjust practices must be opposed and rejected by injustice, racism and all forms of oppression.
My country appreciates the progressive South African community, the African Union and all others who have supported us in demanding immediate and unconditional removal of these illegal timber, President Mangakwa said.
Those who have imposed these illegal restrictions should listen to the call and remove them now.
Collaboration is the victory of all.
Obstacles are failures for all.
Zimbabwe should be allowed to resume.
At the beginning of this thousand years, the West, particularly the United States and the European Union (EU), imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe, in protest against the irrevocable land reform plan that sought to correct the land rights inequalities that have continued since the colonial rule.
While both the United States and the European Union claim to be the protectors of democracy and human rights, they block economic growth in Zimbabwe by continuing ethnic barriers.
Researchers have said that these restrictions were used by Western countries as a tactic to bring back citizens against their government by making it difficult to live in Zimbabwe.
At the 39th SADC summit of states and governments in Tanzania, it expressed its support for the country, noting that the ongoing economic sanctions have severely impacted Zimbabwe's economy and the region.
The SATC called for an immediate lifting of sanctions to revive the economy in the country and announced October 25 as a day for the SATC member states to collectively express their opposition to the sanctions through various activities and platforms.
Japan sees North Korea missile as threat to Chinese space operations
Japan has increased its warning about North Koreas missile capabilities, according to a security report, saying that North Korea has not taken any concrete steps to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and has succeeded in producing small scale weapons.
The annual report on security approved by the Cabinet points to Japan's fear of being targeted by its neighbour.
Its response to the recent tests conducted by North Korea is contrary to the US 'low response.
Since the failure of this year's summit between the United States and North Korea, North Korea has launched 10 new and advanced short-range missiles and missiles.
The security report also notes that Chinas threat is expanding from the regional sea to space.
Japan is strengthening its security through its partnership with the US and is launching its space division and operations against cyber and electronic attacks.
Britain is on the verge of a turning point as Brexit protesters admit their opinion is wrong
"Kalarbab insisted that MPs who want to oppose Brexit in Parliament will soon realise that they are in the" "wrong place." ""
Members of Parliament are actively fighting with Boris Johnson and his cabinet to ensure that Britain does not leave the European Union without an official agreement.
Speaking over the phone on Mike Graham's doctoral show, Bob said: 'I think this is a turning point as the Brexit opponents have started showing who they really are in Parliament.'
They did not want Brexit to happen with the agreement, they do not want Brexit to happen.
They are becoming more and more frank and frustrated as they feel that what they are doing is fundamentally wrong.
"Bob continued:" "The main reason for this is that he opposes the sovereign people of this country."
All these things are moving towards a basic thing, which is a wonderful thing in our country - that is our Constitution.
Many people say that we dont have a constitution, we have it.
On Thursday, Boris Johnson refused to apologize for saying that it was an act of surrendering efforts to prevent him from leaving the European Union without entering into an agreement.
But the Prime Minister agreed that any new agreement he is entering into with the European Union should be able to 'communicate' with the opposition MPs, as he should get the support of the opposition MPs.
Speaking to BBC South, Mr. Johnson said: I will need to contact the underworld.
We are still ready to implement any new legal and implementable proposal from the European Union
Following the aggressive debates in the Lower House, Speaker John Berrow urged the MPs to give up their negative behaviour.
"Mr. Berrow said:" "I think they are full of a feeling, and the events of yesterday are not in harmony with the values of the House."
I know that in 22 years, I have never seen a worse situation in this House.
Emotions were burning on both sides, provocative words emerged, which was a bad culture.
Trump attacks secret person's evidence, calls complaint a treason: News
"" "Attacking Thursday as" "" almost a spy "", "" President Donald Trump said his actions were "" "" treason "" "" "to reveal his actions that were" "" "illegal" "" "" in connection with Ukraine, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times reported. "" "
The President said this on Tuesday after National Investigation Agency (NIA) Director Joseph McCoir testified before the House's Investigation Team (SIT) on the complaint, it announced that an inquiry would be initiated to sack Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Khalifa) Trump.
An unnamed US intelligence official has accused Trump of pressurising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over phone in July to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Biden is set to take on Donald Trump in 2020
Thereafter, the White House tried to hide the talks, the complaint said.
The Los Angeles Times recorded a audio clip of Trump calling him a spy in front of staff who had gone to the United Nations in New York City on behalf of the United States.
At the bottom, the person never saw the report, never saw the call, he decided without ever seeing the call, whether it was a man or a woman, they were almost a psychopath, Trump said.
Who filed the complaint?
Because he is like a psychopath, the President continued.
Do you know what we will do in the past when we are well aware of spies and sedition?
Unlike now, we have treated it differently.
According to NBC News, no one has been punished in the United States in the last 70 years for treason that could be sentenced to death.
Earlier on Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee had issued a complaint declaring that there was no secret before Makur's trial.
Trump's call to Gelensky was' abuse of power for personal gain 'and the White House lawyers told White House officials to store a copy of the call in an electronic system for handling confidential information.
"" "The McCoir, appointed by Trump last month to lead the US intelligence community, testified on Thursday that he thought he was" "" "well intentioned" "" "when the advertiser filed the complaint." ""
I fully believe that they did everything as per the rules and followed the law, he told the committee.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Khalifa) condemned Trump's attack on the complainant and his evidence.
"" "Condemned call for violence against witnesses in our investigation," "" "Shif said in a tweet." ""
All Americans should condemn such threats to the Witnesses.
The doubles match against the Belfast Giants will be as difficult as it has been so far
The doubles match against Belfast at the end of this week will be the toughest for the five players this season.
Head coach Dodd Duusheim says that his team that meets the Elite League champions of the season, who went on a boat trip to the Northern Ireland capital on Saturday and went back to the Fife Ice Stadium on Sunday, should take up the challenge.
"We saw the Belfast team as a very talented, fully capable, physically capable and hard-working team in the game records," "Doots said."
I think this will be the toughest match in this team so far and I want to play better.
After two matches in Group B, both teams have two points from one win and one loss.
The matches to be held over the weekend will play an important role in deciding the first three places and the chances of qualifying.
The Kirkland team will need to find a way out to cross former netmender Shane Owen, who went to the Belfast team in the summer following a good season in the Faf team.
"We have great respect not only for Shane but also for all our former players." ""
He was selected by the opponents for a reason, and he seems to have played well in the team.
We will be sure of the opportunity to shake hands with him after the match, but till then it will remain the same.
Instead of focusing on who we know and who we dont know, we have to play with the existing people and be ready to win two important wins in the Challenge Cup.
Focusing on the weekend final of the tournament, they lost 4-2 at Guildford on Sunday after a 24-hour series of bus trips, but got a good start in their league matches by finishing first in points.
While their team won from the start, Duchess believes there is a possibility of further progress.
There has been a great start this season, but in all three parts of the snow, I want to improve the recovery of the bug in a defensive manner.
It is a region that needs further progress.
For example, in the Nottingham Games, all the six players played in a significant way in keeping themselves and in handling them again when they were handed over.
It is a responsibility to follow the scheme and work hard in all aspects of the game.
If the ball goes inside, Kohli or the defenders will be criticized immediately, but that is the last defence.
All the players have to go and play on both sides at all times, which is going to be important for our success.
It would be good to be at the top of the points table, but if we think that is enough, we have not done our job.
We have to fight to keep on the top of the points table, which requires determination every night.
After receiving nine small penalties at Gilford on Sunday, Gilford also stressed the importance of keeping five players on the snow.
"We faced a penalty problem from the beginning, which changed the course of the game to a great extent." ""
We have to be outside the box continuously because if we have to be lagging behind most of the time at the start of the hockey game, even if it is involved in the latter, you will lose the momentum of the game and it is difficult to get it back.
All the teams will talk about getting a good start, getting a good start, getting a positive state mentally and physically.
"We look forward to being isolated because a team plays well against us and reduces people, so if we follow the plan and are patient, we will be more successful than trying to pass," "he said."
We have got the best attack players, so we are not worried about Powerplay, we have to go there and stay tense and ensure that we do not stand idle.

DeSec Opens New Ireland Embassy in Los Angeles
DeSec opens new Irish Embassy in Los Angeles
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was also present at the event.
It is one of the new foreign embassies that have been opened in a row as part of the Governments initiative of Global Ireland, which aims to double Ireland's international presence by 2025
Disc Los Angeles is a two-day professional tour focusing on Ireland's growing television and film industry.
He will meet senior officials from leading companies of the world, studios and networks, including Netflix, Hulu, Skydance and Fox Churchlight.
The government plans to double the number of audio-visual units in the next five years by increasing the production process and increasing the number of workers employed in the industry to 24,000.
Questions arise as fire breaks out at French chemical factory
As the Paris (AP) - French authorities and residents of Normandy are removing the remains of a huge fire that has engulfed a chemical factory, foul smell continues to spread in the large part of the region.
While no one was injured in a fire at a Lubrikand plant in Rovan on Thursday, residents have expressed concern over the possible health risks and damage to the Sin River.
The regional administration chief announced on Friday that the fire was extinguished on Thursday night, almost 24 hours later.
Fire brigade is still at the spot.
Authorities warned that the new smell after the fire was extinguished could spread to other nearby areas as well.
Home Minister Christopher Castner said those in critical condition should not come out overnight on Friday night.
The plant is one of the most dangerous industrial areas in Europe.
Toyota is expected to increase its stake in Subaru by more than 20%.
Two people who were directly aware of Toyota's plans to increase its stake in Subaru from the current 17% to 20% on Friday said that the small company is also investing in Japan's premier automaker.
They refused to disclose their identities as they did not inform everyone that the agreement would be approved at the Governing Council meeting on Friday.
The investment will be made within a month after Toyota and another Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor, have said that they are buying small shares from each other.
Such connections show how vehicle manufacturers are struggling to control costs and boost growth.
Traditional car manufacturers, especially small companies like Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to cope with rapid changes in the sector due to increase in electric vehicles, modes of transport and automatic vehicles.
Based on Subura's stock market value, Toyota's investment will cost more than 70 billion yen ($650 million), according to the Nikkei Business magazine, which first reported.
In return, one of them told Reuters that Subra would invest an amount equivalent to Toyota's additional investment.
The representatives of both Toyota and Subra said that this was an undisclosed news by their company.
Subaru has a strong presence in sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and all-wheel drive technology
In June, the two automakers had said that they were planning to manufacture an electric sport-utility vehicle on a platform jointly developed by the two companies to cut costs.
Car manufacturers across the world are joining hands to reduce the cost of development and production of new technology.
Ford Motor and Volkswagen have announced that they will spend billions of dollars together to manufacture electric and automatic vehicles.
Like some of its competitors, Toyota seems to be more interested in investing in small and domestic automakers than in connecting with other countries.
It is looking to expand the scale in next generation technology and provide free access to patents for electric vehicle motors and power control units this year.
On Friday morning, Toyota's shares fell 0.9%, while Subura's shares fell 1.5%.
Before traveling to Liverpool to Sheffield United, Jurgen Globe provides new information about the Sadeo Man's injury.
Sadeo Man plays a Liverpool match against Sheffield United.
When Liverpool beat Chelsea 2-1 last Sunday, Senegal failed to play 2-0 against MK Dance in the Karaba Cup on Wednesday evening due to a foot injury.
But Mann trained with his team on Thursday, and there was no concern about the former player when his team went to Pramathlon for the opening match on Saturday.
"Both Sadeo and Viv [Divak Oregi] trained yesterday, were normal, there was no problem," "said the Liverpool manager."
Claub also confirmed that Sherton Shagiri was still out when James Milner was expected to recover from a back injury sustained during the win against the MK Dance team.
"The shock is not yet ready, he is training to come back," "Glaf said."
Milli hit him on the back right from the start of the match against the MK Dance team and after the match he felt a little embarrassed but he should be fine.
He will begin his first training with Liverpool's Alison
Over the weekend, the Liverpool goalkeeper will return to his first training with the team to be expected for a long time.
The Brazilian international was ruled out of the first match of the season on August 9 due to a knee injury.
Although he does not have enough time to be considered for the Sheffield United, which will begin on Saturday afternoon, he will join the team after 24 hours as preparations for the Red Bull Salzburg Champions League to start in his home town.
"Allison seems to have recovered completely, but can only be said with the final word of the medical department," "said manager Jurgen Klaf."
He will not be considered for tomorrow's competition.
They can join the team from Sunday and train.
I am not a doctor, I hear what they say.
Alison's injury is serious, but she has been recovering well in the last two weeks.
This will make the medical fraternity proud.
He waited for him to start training.
Sadio Mane has completely recovered from the hamstring muscle problem during last week's win in Selcia, and there are some good news about the injury as another forward, Divok Oregi, who missed three matches due to ankle problems, has recovered.
"Both Sadio Man and Divock Oregi trained yesterday and there was no problem," "Glaf added."
However, he is yet to return to the squad after suffering a knee injury on Monday.
How dare you?
Tanberg's speech at the UN encourages Dutch climate protesters
The Hawks (Reuters) - Referring to a speech at the United Nations by Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, thousands of Dutch children on Friday avoided going to school to join a global climate strike, changed traffic, and asked their leaders, How dare you?
At a protest rally against climate change in the Netherlands on September 27, 2019, a participant has put up a painting depicting Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg.
The rally in The Hawk was more than expected when the organizers were estimated to gather around 35,000.
The police had to shift the procession to a more comfortable place.
Thunberg, 16, delivered an emotional address at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, just before the UN Climate Summit, after participating in millions of people around the world's climate strike.
The strike is going to have a huge impact not only today but also in the future when people continue to participate, in which people from different walks of life can be seen participating, said Rander Rustima, a protester.
"The protesters marched through the heart of the city, holding banners that read" "old age will kill you," "" "climate change will kill us." ""
"" "I understand their concerns and hope they will be taken into account," "Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rudd told reporters at a weekly press conference near the venue of the protest."
We have provided ambitious schemes to deal with these problems.
But we have to do it in a prudent manner that also creates employment.
Despite decades of warnings by scientists, Danberg's brief speech to the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and industry to address the global stagnation on carbon emissions that had reached the highest level last year.
"How dare you?" ""
With a population of 17 million, the Netherlands produced less than 7 percent of all types of energy from renewable energy sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and more than half of all types of energy in Sweden.
The government is committed to half of CO2 emissions by 2030 from 1990 to 2017, but only 13 per cent reduction in 2017.
Thunberg was participating in a demonstration in Montreal, Canada, where the leaders of the United Nations Aviation Sector met on Friday to discuss the targets for the release of flights.
North Korea denounces US 'inaction' to lift sanctions after nuclear talks
North Korea accused the United States of not doing anything to implement what was agreed upon at the summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but said it trusted the US President's wise choice and bold decision.
A few days after Mr. Trump summed up another summit with Kim, a report by Kim Gay Kwan, Advisor on Foreign Affairs at the United Nations, by the North Korean delegation, said:
I am interested that holding another DBRK-US summit is now being talked about as a big thing in America, 'the consultant used the acronym for the country's official name, the Korean People's Democratic Republic.
But he criticised the US for not working after the summit.
"Kim Gai Kwan said the previous summits were" "historic moments" "for the two leaders to put an end to the hostile relationship between the two countries and express their political commitment to maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."
The State Department Advisor said North Korea has made sincere efforts to build trust by implementing a statement issued jointly by Washington and Pyongyang after the first summit between Kim and Trump in Singapore last year.
He also mentioned the deportation of the captured Americans for 'acts of hatred' against North Korea and the return of the goods of the soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.
However, the US did nothing to implement the joint statement, the North Korean official said.
On the contrary, he referred to the resumption of the US-South Korea joint military exercise, noting that 'the US President had personally promised to stop it' and continued to impose sanctions against North Korea.
Kim Gai Kwan said it was a bitter truth that North Korea's idea of 'first nuclear disarmament' before the sanctions were lifted and then 'a better future for the country' was driving the politicians in Washington.
As a result, he is doubting whether another summit will usher in a new beginning in US-North Korea relations, the adviser said.
But he gave me another chance.
Looking at his approach to North Korea, I am aware that President Trump has changed his political knowledge and finally from his predecessors, so I would like to believe in President Trumps wise choice and bold decision, he said.
Kim Gai Kwan, a senior political expert in the mid-70s, most of the time led the North Korean delegation during the six-nation nuclear disarmament talks in Beijing in 2003-2008.
In his address to the Global Conference on Tuesday, Mr Trump summed up North Korea and said that the US has taken a bold political decision on the Korean Peninsula.
I told Kim Jong Un what I really believe: his country is full of unused power like Iran, but to fulfill that promise, North Korea must reduce nuclear weapons, 'the US President said.
North Korea began talks with the United States last year, saying it was ready to give up its nuclear weapons development through talks in exchange for security guarantees and removal of sanctions.
North Korea wants a gradual nuclear disarmament and the United States to do something at par with each of its nuclear disarmament measures.
The US has said that sanctions will continue until North Korea takes significant steps to dismantle its nuclear arsenal.
During the Singapore summit, Kim Jong Un committed to working to make the Korean Peninsula completely unnuclear, without presenting any schedule or map for nuclear disarmament measures.
Kim and Trump agreed in Singapore to build new bilateral relations and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.
They met again in Vietnam in February for the second summit.
However, the meeting failed immediately after Mr Trump rejected Kim's demand for a comprehensive relief to demolish his main nuclear complex as a measure of nuclear disarmament.
At the end of July, the two leaders met for less time on the Korean border without any progress and agreed to resume talks.
Indian Army helicopter crashes in Bhutan, 2 killed
An Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) helicopter crashed in eastern Bhutan on Friday, killing two people, including a Bhutanese pilot.
While the helicopter left Kirmu in Arunachal Pradesh, the Army said it lost contact with Yanpura and found scattered parts.
In an unfortunate incident, an Indian Army helicopter crashed near Yanpula in Bhutan at 1 pm.
The helicopter lost contact with radio after 1 pm and disappeared from vision.
The helicopter went from Kirmu (Arunachal) to Yanbula for work, the Army said in a statement.
Rescue and search operations were launched immediately.
Scattered parts have been found.
Indian Air Force and Army helicopters also left for Missouri, Guwahati and Hashimara.
The Army said the single-engine Ceta helicopter was operated by an Indian and a Bhutanese military pilot and no one survived.
Boris Johnson attacks Scotland government over 'severe deficiencies'
The Prime Minister attacked the SNP, saying he was planning to introduce compensation measures for severe deficits
Speaking ahead of the Conservative Party meeting, Boris Johnson said that no matter how he exits from Brexit or without an agreement, he will speed up measures to build a strong Scotland economy.
He also reiterated his strong opposition to the second Scottish independence vote.
In an interview with the BBC Scotland, Mr. Johnson said: They impose the highest tax throughout the United Kingdom.
They have not done well in health and education.
Scotland's Chief Minister Nicolas Sturgeon supported the possibility of a second independent poll.
I hope that the amount that we now invest will be properly spent on these services.
I am confident that Scotland will join the Conservative Party, not Nicola Sturgeon, but the Scotland Conservative Party. '
Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon had already said that another vote was needed to leave the United Kingdom in the second half of 2020, but Mr. Johnson had earlier expressed his opposition to the second vote on the issue.
On Thursday, the BBC told Scotland: 'We conducted a poll for independence in 2014, when we had openly assured the people of Scotland that this would happen only once in a lifetime.
The people of Scotland voted to continue in the United Kingdom, and this was the right decision as it was the successful unity in any part of the world.
They were assured that this will happen once in a lifetime and I think we will continue to do so.
"In a tweet on Wednesday, Chief Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Johnson as" "unreliable and unconcerned about the consequences of his words or actions." ""
Wesmester's opposition parties must support the plan to bring a no-confidence motion to overthrow Johnson's government, ensure that the Ben Act is followed and pave the way for a general election as soon as possible
Nothing should be done.
Interviews with Mr. Johnson have been sought from the Government of Scotland.
Mugabe will be buried in Swimba as the government accepts the family's request
The family of the late President Mugabe has given permission to bury him in the Swimba land in Mashonaland West in place of a tomb being built on the National Heroes acres.
Information Secretary Nick Mangwana said in an interview that the family has the right to choose the burial site of the former Zimbabwean leader who died in Singapore on September 6.
The family of former President R G Mugabe had expressed their desire to bury him in Swimba.
In accordance with the policy of the Government to respect the wishes of the late leaders, the Government cooperates with the new wishes of the Mugabe family.
Under the leadership of the family members of the late former President, the Government will extend all necessary cooperation for his efficient burial.
Maurin Kademonga, a member of the Nelson Samisa-led Democratic Transformation Movement, told the VOA Zimbabwe Service about the recent changes to the funeral of Mugabe, that the burial of the late President would cost the country a lot of money as the tomb being built in Harare was abandoned without proper consultation with the stakeholders.
The Mugabe family has said that they do not want to do anything on the Hero acre.
They have been saying this since the day he was declared dead.
So they did just that.
So they have wasted all the money and our MPs are going to ask for responsibility.
We would like to know how much money was spent on that project and how they are going to pay for it.
The family says the late President will be buried on Saturday.
Antonio Caraco to fight against Amarsana Sohu in Jakarta
Antonio Caraco sees a lot of similarities between AFL and fighting each other in a cage.
While opposite to watching both the games, the determination to succeed is the same.
It was surprising that a new life in Florida, with training with global competitors to prepare for the launch of the One Championship MMA, revealed some of the characteristics that were seen during his Amateur Football days in Salisbury West.
"Imagine you are playing at AFL, but you are training with an amateur club, then go on Saturday and play with the AFL players," "he said."
Of course you can kick and catch the same, but the mood and speed will change.
In a few days I will easily win, in some rounds I will lose badly, but before that, I had no challenge in my own place.
This was followed by a rigorous training session conducted by former UFC welder weight champion Robbie Leller at the Hart Knox MMA gymnasium, the home location of Caruso outside their home location.
The 28-year-old, who was not defeated, said that it was this difficult exercise that put Mongolian Amarsana Sohu in a better position to face in Jakarta on October 25.
You may need to fight three or four champions at some point of time and fight them together, he said.
That is the biggest change here, there are no easy rounds, no easy work.
I cannot run the training session and train after that, they are better than me.
But I have gained strength from it.
Before going to Asia's largest MMA promotional event, Soku (5W-1), who made his debut in 2016, won the MGL-1 Light Weight Championship in October.
But under head coach Henry Hooft, Caruso feels like a new man.
As a coach, Henry is far ahead of others and has seen all the worst days since the best days of a player.
Such an experience will not be easy for you, he said.
(Chogu) The way he grew up is different from me, but as far as talent and skills are concerned, he has what he needs, but that is not enough.
He is going to be determined, but it will not keep you alive for a long time in this competition.
The main event in the competition will be a one-welder weight champion Sebastian Gadestam, who will take on Gimrian Abasso to retain his title.
The power producers are accused of producing renewable energy to attract environmentalists.
"The electricity supplied to your house is 100 per cent renewable," "says one provider, and that guarantee is" "impossible" "?"
In order to make their power renewable, the organization calls for a clarification by the Government Department of Consumer Affairs on the definition of renewable energy as the suppliers are personally dependent only on REGO and provide very little support for renewable power generation.
"" "While customers are more concerned about the environment, some suppliers claim to be producing renewable energy, which may pose a risk of misleading customers," "the chief editor said."
We hope that there should be more clarity on the definition of renewable energy and the way it is marketed.
People can decide from whom to buy electricity only if the companies are more clear to the customers about their renewable production.
For this study, a study of 355 tariff rates in June 2019 found that 20 suppliers sold 100% renewable energy without any agreement to buy renewable energy.
World Athletics Championships: Kidambi Srikanth enters 400m final
On Friday, the opening day of the World Athletics Championships in Doha, the long-time sprinter M Sreesanth failed to qualify for the final while the 400m hurdles reached the semi-finals.
Another 400m hurdles, national record holder Tarun Ayyasamy, failed to qualify for the semifinals after the last hurdle in his qualification bout.
The 20-year-old Shankar finished 22nd in the qualification round with a maximum of 7.62m in his three attempts.
His effort was much lower than his maximum of 8.00 m this season, which he had crossed last month in Patiala.
Later on the day, Jabir, who finished third in the first qualifier and overall 11th, ran in 49.62 seconds to qualify for the semifinals on Saturday.
The best time for him this season and personally is 49.13 seconds.
Ayyasamy lost time due to the last ban and took 50.55 seconds to run.
In the fifth round, he failed to qualify for the semi-finals, finishing sixth and 27th overall.
Ayyasamy, who recently recovered from the injury, has a personal and best time of 48.80 seconds for the season.
The top four in each qualification round and the fourth fastest four will qualify for the semifinals of the 400m hurdles.
Sri Shankar became the first Indian to cross the individual maximum and national record of 8.20m.
He first covered a distance of 7.52 m and then a distance of 7.62 m.
He made a mistake in his third and final attempts and left disappointed.
It was decided to cross 8.15m to qualify automatically for the final, but only one crossed it.
The other 11 players qualified for the final with a minimum distance of 7.89m.
His second short distance this season is 7.62m.
He had crossed 7.53m in the qualification round of the National Inter-State Championship held in Lucknow last month.
He has crossed the 8.00m mark in Patiala on August 16, three times in the 7.90s.
However, his best distance this season was second from the end as compared to the 27 players who participated in the qualifying round.
Karen Benz is said to be very angry with Trump's' Access Hollywood 'tape
Karen Ben, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, has been accused of being angry over the Oxus Hollywood tape released a month before the 2016 presidential election.
"In an interview with Bences for The Associated Press and Indianapolis Star, Tampianco reveals that he was very dissatisfied with the record in his new book" "Bytie & Power: Mike Pence and The Docking of the White House." ""
In 2005, Donald Trump spoke proudly about holding women in his genitals without the consent of women in that country.
"The New York Times wrote in a newspaper article on Friday morning that Karen was" "very angry" "with Trump's bad ideas in the" "Access Hollywood" "country."
However, her husband decided not to stop her from giving tickets.
On the night of the election day, Lobyanco said in his book that Karen Bains refused to kiss her husband.
Mike, you've got what you want.
Leave me alone, he said.
Peter Baker, a New York Times correspondent, feels that his wife, Karen Ben, has a great influence on him who refuses to meet women without his wife.
In 2002, Mike Pence, an evangelizer, cynically said that he did not eat alone with a woman other than his wife and would not attend alcoholic banquets without his wife.
When the comments were republished in 2017, she was attacked by critics for saying that she did not consider women as equal qualified experts and that women working for her were not given the same opportunities as men.
"The" "white man in the eye" "meme is now using his popularity to raise funds for the Multiple Chelsea Foundation."
He became 33 years old when TrueScanlan became the GIF used by users confused with growing stupid reviews online.
He is now cycling 120 miles from San Francisco to Wine County for the National Multiple Celeros Society, along with 10 bikes.
He has returned his followers to his fundraising page and raised over $37,000.
Using his fame on Twitter, Mr. Scanlan said: O the Internet users!
If this GIF has ever made you laugh before, I would like to ask you to consider donating to the National MS Society.
This will be of great benefit to me and to those I know who are suffering from this disease!
He explained on his fundraising page the reasons for choosing to support the MS Foundation.
I usually don't want to be proud of my own meme, but this event is an exception.
Both my close friends and their families have been affected by MS disease, which affects the central nervous system and prevents communication between the brain and the body.
Lakhs of people have been affected by MS disease and there is no cure for it.
This is where you can help.
Megan 'fulfills the desires of his heart and' refuses to let his own needs' disintegrate 'with his royal family's work.
Megan Markle is determined not to 'satisfy the desires of her heart' and 'dissolve' her own needs. He now wants to be a member of a royal family a role model for young children and women.
Princess Sussex, 38, said this during an event for women entrepreneurs at the Cape Town Woodstock Exchange this week during her visit to South Africa with her husband, Prince Harry.

We both have sons and we have an example not only for girls but also for children - we are an example not only for our sons but also for the public in the public.
He added that Megan does not feel that there is a person from the upper echelons as women come together and move forward about our struggles, grow up and talk about what we have to do to change our societies.
McMahon, founder of the skill training institute Simodisa, said that despite being a member of the royal family, Megan is determined to continue fighting for the problems close to her heart.
"" "Being a mother, having duties as a princess, fulfilling what her heart wants - now that she is a princess, she will not just melt away," "Modi recalls."
You have to be real to yourself.
The Princess insisted on continuing her new thinking and said that she should know that it was for others who followed them to move forward and stop moving forward.
"Not talking about being a government family, he spoke about life in general where there are challenges," "Modi said, adding that it was" "astounding" "to see the cloud."
"" "He expresses his compassion and does this work with compassion," "Modi said."
Although we have seen many wonderful things as founders, it is a wonderful meeting with the royal family.
He made it easy.
He belongs to a simple royal family.
"" "Megan admitted that being a working mother was" "" "a lot of meaning" "" "and" "" "a lot of enthusiasm" "" "between being a royal family and taking care of child Archie." ""

Maria da Bhide de Jesus, Minister of Culture, Louunda-Angola, spoke about the need to popularize and renovate the Iron Palace in Luanda and make it a cultural hub.
He was speaking at an opportunity to meet the French Ambassador to Angola in Luanda on Friday with a view to strengthening cultural cooperation between the countries.
Maria de Jesus said that the aim is to make good use of infrastructure and make it available to the public.

Maria da Bhide de Jesus said that the aim is to transform the Iron Palace into a place for cultural interaction and act as a workshop to discover new values of Angola's culture.
Emmanuel Christian School: Students of Class VI in Virginia have been accused of forcibly cutting a black woman's hair.
A black middle school student in Virginia has accused three white students of forcibly cutting their hair.
The incident took place at Emmanuel Christian School in which Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Benz, is a teacher.
"The 12-year-old American Allen, a student of a private K-12 Christian school, said the students had cut their cigar on the playground during the break, saying it was" "obscene and" "disgusting." ""
"They made fun of me and called me by my surname," "he told CBS co-founder WUSA television in tears."
I am rude and I should not be born.
Everyone will look at me, he said.
According to the WUSA, one of the students is said to have covered the mouth of the United States, while the other is said to have come behind her and held her hands, and the third is said to have cut her hair with a knife in her hands.
She did not tell her family about it until her grandmother found out that the length of the American hair had decreased.
"They ran away smiling, and I just sat down," "she said."
The incident is said to have taken place on Monday, but the noisy woman, who was before the age of fourteen, did not inform her family until her grandmother found out that her hair was different on Wednesday.
He said he feared that they would take revenge if they told the truth.
"America's grandmother Scindia Allen said," "This is very disturbing." ""
I have to see them being expelled from school.
I have to see any action being taken.
The famous school against LGBTQ was reported earlier this year when Karen Ben joined as an art teacher.
"We are deeply concerned about the mental health and health of all our students and will not accept any threat or misbehaviour," "Emmanuel Christian School said in a statement."
We are deeply saddened by the allegations and are in touch with the family of the alleged victim in gathering information and providing all possible assistance.
We are in touch with the Law Enforcement Department for a thorough investigation and further investigations will be carried out by the Farfax County Police.
While threatening others will not be tolerated at school, the students have already harassed themselves, he said.
He said that the students had taken their food and in the past they had called themselves after their surname.
The family of the United States met school authorities on Thursday and an investigation is underway.
PM Modi pays tribute to Jacques Chirac as a true international statesman, friend of India
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the passing away of former French President Jacques Chirac and said that India regrets the passing away of a true international statesman and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who supported India's nuclear test in 1998, died on Thursday at the age of 86.
He served as French President from 1995 to 2007.
My deepest condolences on the passing away of Jacques Chirac.
India grieves the passing away of a true international statesman.
As a friend of India, he made an important contribution in building and building an important partnership between India and France, the Prime Minister tweeted.
India and France have important cooperation, which began in January 1998 during the first visit of Jacques Chirac to India.
He returned to India in 2006 as the President of that country.
Jacques Chirac is said to be suffering from a prolonged illness.
"Mickey Arthur says the comments about Wasim Akram and Misbah-ul-Haq are" "dignified." ""
The committee decided not to renew Arthur's contract, which led to the appointment of Mizpah as the chairman and new head coach of the country's selection committee.
Arthur said he supported the participation of both Wasim and Mizba in the committee, but the decision was disappointing when he believed in them.
"I think my only disappointment in all this is that a few people I really believed in did not act accordingly," "Arthur said during the interview."
It was a coincidence that Mizba was part of our committee that did not renew our contract and that he came to that position, he added.
In an interview, Arthur refused to say anything wrong about Mizpah.
Misbah will do well, Mizba is a good human being, it is the decision of the Pakistan Cricket Board.
I am disappointed that I loved every moment of this work.
These comments created a flutter in the Pakistani media, which has been spreading rumours about cricket.
Speaking to AFP over phone from Perth, he said that he had the right to speak what was in his mind when the team worked faithfully for three years.
"I love Pakistan and the players I have worked together, have spent three years with them and have respect for Misba and Wasim, so I have made respectful comments," "Arthur told AFP."
I feel disappointed because I have a few things in the Pakistan team that I have not finished, it would have been better had I continued.
But now we have crossed it and my best wishes to the Pakistan team under Mizba.
Wasim and Misbah both said their actions were right after the World Cup.
"I have played for Pakistan and I am working for Pakistan cricket in some way or the other, so when I was asked to join the decision making committee, I gave my honest opinion," "Wasim told AFP in Karachi."
Arthur has the right to voice his opinion, Misba added.
"I think he has expressed his opinion," "she said."
He said what he thought.
I have always said that everyone has an opinion.
As a member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), we gave our honest opinion.
I had a very good relationship with Egypt, he added.
"Good relations have always been there and will remain so," "the current head coach of Pakistan added."
Passenger held for urinating in Sydney train
A horrific video of a passenger urinating on a Sydney train went viral as the school students stood in a state of shock a few metres away.
A Sydney woman named Jordi Lee shared a video of the incident on Facebook at 8.30 am on a train between Verington and Kingswood.
"Share this pig to everyone," "he said."
He does this in front of the children who go to school this morning.
The account shows a male passenger urinating on the ground at the end of ten years standing on a wire near the doors of the box.
According to the Penrith Press, it has been recorded by two students to show the bad conduct of man.
The boy's mother posted the incident on her Facebook page, claiming that the incident had made her very disgusted.
I am very shocked that this happened in front of the school going children on a busy Friday, he said.
Even my dog will not do that.
When they entered, their children told him that the man was sleeping in the seats and then got up and started urinating on the ground.
After urination, the man is said to have returned to a seat and slept again.
Many Facebook users have raised their voice against the man's hateful behaviour.
What an animal!
This is very disgusting.
"Please urinate before leaving the house," "said another."
A Sydney Train spokesperson said passengers should immediately complain about such behaviour.
Sydney Trains encourage passengers to treat others with respect while travelling in our train series.
While such incidents are rare, we urge passengers to immediately inform the railway police or station staff who have seen such incidents.
Transport officers travel throughout the train chain, have the power to issue penal announcements and travel crimes and warnings for minor behavioural crimes.
We are working closely with the New South Wales traffic police officers responsible for curbing crime in the train series, he said.
Only police personnel have the power, training and resources to respond effectively to crimes.
A fine of $400 to $1100 can be imposed for misconduct.
Ireland's Goddie continues to be in great form in 2019
According to Stephen Perris, Jack Carter was named in the match against Japan as a reward for his consistent performance over the past year in both Conact and Ireland.
The 27-year-old, who made his international debut in late February, made his last appearance as an alternative to Ireland in a six-nation tournament against Italy.
Since then, he has made an impact every time he has played eight games, including the performance of Ireland when they broke the Scotland team and introduced them in the second half on Sunday.
On Saturday, Carter was given the opportunity to play in his second international match, the first opportunity when he won the World Cup training match against Wales at the Cardiff Stadium.
A few years ago, several out-of-hand players tried to train under Johnny Sexton, who was born in Atlon grew up to challenge Joy Carbury to the place.
Speaking at the RTE Rugby Patkast, Ferris says that Gardy was an out-hob player who continued to excel throughout Ireland in 2019, including Johnny Sexton.
I think he played very well (against Scotland)
He was the defence of the Scotland team and knew what he had to do.
Sometimes he played according to the situation.
His defence was somewhat good when he was not able to kick and play.
I would say that Cardi has been a player who has consistently excelled in the last one year or in the same time as Ireland.
He played very well.
He never gave up his team every week.
As far as sex is concerned...
In the last one year or so, Johnny has played badly in a few matches.
He was out with injuries.
His performance was a bit unstable.
But Cardi truly demonstrated stable performance.
You need someone who shows a stable talent when they have a lot of support against the Japanese team that is going to play with full potential.
That is sports management.
I think he will not abandon Joe.
I am looking forward to seeing how he plays from the start of a game and handles the entire situation.
Its such a big game.
Japan is the only major threat to us among the rest of our teams.
But even if I say that, I dont think Japan will win us if we look at the confidence and enthusiasm of the Ireland team now.
Hundreds of dolphins die off African coast
More than 100 dolphins died secretly on a beach on the Cape Verde Islands in West Africa.
Local media reported that about 200 megalion-head-dolphins were lying on a beach on the island of Bova Vista on Tuesday.
Officials, residents and tourists pulled some of them back into the sea, but many dolphins have returned.
136 dead dolphins were buried with the help of bulldozers.
Bios Cape Verde, a volunteer environmental organization in the former Portuguese colony, said on their Facebook page on Friday that they had taken samples from 50 dolphins and four dolphins were frozen by the local council.
Veterinary doctors from the University of Los Palmas in the Canary Islands of Spain will come for trials in the coming days, the organisation said.
Paralympian to become first visually impaired contestant to dance on snow
Scotland Paralympian Lipi Gleck has been named as the contestant for the next series to dance on snow.
The athlete will be the first visually impaired to be registered on the occasion, winning a gold medal at the 2014 Glasgow Games for Scotland and two medals at the 2016 Rio Games for the United Kingdom.
The 29-year-old woman, who gave birth to a boy named Edward five months ago, has a deteriorating eyesight and has a slight vision in her left eye
"He said," "I thought, 'What else can I do after achieving my final goal in the Rio Games?'"
I got this opportunity and I could not give up.
I would like to challenge myself and experience new things.
Senior comedian and TV host Michael Berimor, Love Island star Mara Hickins and former Irish footballer Kevin Gilfane will join the Paralympic player.
John Baromen, born in Glasgow, is the only Scottish to join the jury this year.
Every week, twelve celebrities and their couples will do direct skating and try to attract the jury and the audience who decide the winners at the end.
The show, which will re-air on STV in 2020, will be re-hosted by Philip Schofield and Halley Wilby.
Cisobernia discrimination should not punish Matt Tea Grid
It has been found that Matthew de Grud, who killed five people at a dinner in Kalkari in 2016, was not criminally responsible for his actions.
An inquiry is now being conducted in the year 2019 to decide whether he will be given more freedom or not to go out without monitoring.
And for a few more weeks it will not be decided, so in the middle of the time we have time to think whether it is a good idea or not.
This can be said in two ways: one is to refer to the bad conduct of the past and prevent it from happening again and the other is to believe in the power of change and resurrection.
First, let us look at its negative side.
In a state of shock, Tea Grid stabbed five people to death.
It is a serious and negative attack.
He was diagnosed with schizophrenia, so he was found to be not legally responsible, but since then he has approached a psychiatrist and has been taking medicines.
"His psychiatrist Chandoch Roy told the review board," "If Matthew de Groud commits another crime again, it will be serious." ""
Though his behaviour is said to have improved, there is still a possibility of reprehensible.
But is this sufficient to fear?
Is this enough to keep the tea cup closed?
As long as tea grade continues to take drugs, the risk of committing crime again is not great, so why do people worry so much?
I believe that the reason for this fear is the sense of discrimination among the people about mental illness, especially Sisobernia.
Specific mental illnesses such as mental disorders and mental disorders do not show much discrimination.
But others, including Cisobernia, are highly discriminated.
The main reason for this is that many people are portrayed as dangerous as they continue to raise their voice saying kill others in the head of people with schizophrenia.
This is the situation, but such incidents are rare, that is why we remember them when they happen.
In fact, the majority of people in Sisobernia are not aggressive, and they are more likely to be targeted than crime or violence.
On the basis of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that Tea Group should not give some of its freedoms, as the fear of committing a crime is based on a discriminatory attitude toward those with Sisobernia rather than on the actual possibility.
I do not agree that tea crowns should be left unmonitored.
An arrangement like parole to check that he continues to take his medicines will be effective.
In a way, arguing that he or others with mental illness should remain in the hospital as long as absolutely necessary is segregated.
This establishes the view that people with mental illness, especially those with schizophrenia, cannot always join the society.
Since the court does not say that he is a criminal, why should he be treated as a prisoner and not as a person who is recovering from mental illness?
Alva Academy offers the world's largest breakfast coffee
Blackmanshire: Alva Academy raises more than 300,000 for McMillan
The school, which raises the highest funding for McMillan cancer aid in the United Kingdom, celebrates the Foundation's' World's largest morning coffee '.
Students and teachers at Alva Academy will welcome the glasser community to one day by offering fun, sports, tea, coffee and cake at school.
On Friday, dozens of fundraising morning coffee events were held across Scotland.
Within Scotland's smallest council area, Alva, located at the foothills of the Ochil Mountains, has raised more than 300,000 for McMillan since 2004.
For years, the teachers and students have organized programmes like Back Sales, Bingo Tea, Sponsor Silence and Seelitz.
Last year, more than 1000 miles of walk, more than 1000 miles of cycling and 101,450 feet of mountaineering won the prestigious Douglas McMillan Award for the school.
This year, students have already participated in favourite events like Skython, Swimathans, Hill Walk, Dock Walk and Bangi Jump.
Their efforts to raise huge funds will be completed with the morning coffee show.
"" "This year everything is going well," "said David Clifford, a teacher who won the United Kingdom's Point of Light Award on behalf of the school."
A large number of supported events, including the Sky, Swimathon, Ben Nevis Walk, Bunky Jumps, Duck Walk, Dance, Football and Reedan Days, were held.
We took the musicians to four different maintenance houses and hosted the Bingo Tea show.
We conducted annual seals, back salts, dog races and more than 1000.
The achievement was led by a trust group comprising David Clifford, Christy Clifford and Shiona Fin.
Writing a song for the musical format of the McMillan video that will continue after the school gratitude meeting, Mr. Clifford said that there was never any pressure to raise more than the previous amount.
On the contrary, the school hopes that the youth will be able to give their valuable time.
It would be good to raise a huge amount, but that amount is just something that reveals what we are doing and what we are doing, he said.
It is enough for us to see our students emulate the values of respect, commitment and service.
Italian hospitals ask government to stop doctors from working until they are 70 years old
Regional health authorities are requesting the Italian government to allow retired doctors to work and those above 65 years of age to work up to 70 years as a way to meet the acute shortage of doctors.
Hospitals across Italy have been demanding that doctors in their region retire at the age of 70 due to shortage of hospital staff.
"The idea is part of a 16-point document to be submitted to the Italian health department in the coming days, with the aim of" "systematic revision of the age limit of retirement of medical workers." ""
At present, Italian doctors can retire if they reach the age of 65 or work for 40 years.
The disruptive regional governments invite those who want to continue to work even after 40 years of service at the age of 66-67.
The capacity of the ageing Italian medical staff is missing.
By 2025, 38,000 doctors (including general doctors, 45,000) would have retired, and the shortfall would be further aggravated by Italian universities that could not train enough graduates to hospitals.
Therefore, the idea of Regional Health Councils is to recruit young medical graduates who do not opt for special courses as general doctors.
It is closely linked with the vision of the regions to finally provide an expert training scholarship amount for awarding contracts to young doctors for a certain period of time and to establish a close work-related relationship between local health authorities and universities, all aimed at accelerating the adoption of the health system to prevent Italy.
Regions like Veneto, which have started searching for retired doctors, have already taken up the problems themselves.
The Molis region in the south has invited military doctors to help, and Tuscany has started recruiting young doctors.
Pompeo accused Syria of using chemical weapons in the May attack.
Speaking on Thursday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US has decided that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said US officials have confirmed the use of chlorine by the Syrian President Bashar Assad government in an attack on enemy forces in the province of Idlib on May 19.
The Azad government has committed countless atrocities, some of which are considered to be war crimes and crimes against humanity, Pompeo said at a press conference.
US officials received a report on a chemical attack in northwest Syria in May, but that did not yield a definitive conclusion at the time.
In April 2018, the United States, Britain and France carried out air strikes in retaliation for a chemical attack suspected to have killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
"It is slightly different because it is chlorine... but President Trump is very serious about protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons," "Pompeo said."
He further said that the US will provide an additional $4.5 million to the organization to prevent the use of chemical weapons to finance the investigation of other incidents suspected to have used Syrian chemical weapons.
Pompeo also asked the Assad regime to release thousands of unfairly captured prisoners, including American journalist Austin Dies, who is believed to have been missing and held by the government for seven years.
We urge the Syrian government to release him, one of the many US citizens captured in Syria, and all of them.
Uber is transforming the app into an effort to create a 'daily living platform'.
In an effort to create a 'platform for daily life' - including integration of its food supply and ride haeling services - Uber has announced a number of updates to its app with a new feature that puts forward services and distinguishes local public transport options.
Uber announced more than 25 changes to its platform at an launch event in San Francisco on Thursday.
One of the most significant initiatives of the company is to integrate its ride haeling app and food delivery app Uber Eats and provide alternate transport information to users including bikes, scooters, public transport and helicopters in some areas.
"We know that being an important part of the lives of the people, it really creates a sense of responsibility," "said Dara Kosrawashahi, Chief Executive Officer, Uber."
That is why we are working to ensure that every customer is treated as an important guest, every driver and courier feels like a valued partner and every city feels like a good citizen.
When passengers search for a location, they will see that the travel options are listed on the basis of the amount, including public transport and electric bikes and scooters.
This means that low cost options such as tunnels and bus schedules may appear at the beginning of the list and they may seek notifications when the trains or buses they are looking after are delayed.
The new travel feature is operational in Denver and London and will soon be operational in San Francisco, Mexico City and Paris.
While it seems unexpected to guide users not to use the car, the company has long intended to be a travel destination with everything.
To a certain extent, we are competing with ourselves, said Kosravanshahi on inclusion of public travel options.
But if there is a good product for the user, we think the integrated solution for the operation is good for the user and we have a policy that we have to be our own competitor rather than others.
"Uber Eats will open more" "digital only restaurants" "- customers need food only through the app, an unusual industry."
One Digital Restaurant is being used in collaboration with renowned chef Rachel Ray, which will be available exclusively through Uber Eats for 10 weeks in 10 cities.
Uber offers these opportunities when it is not able to make profits after several months as a public sector company in May.
In order to control the high cost and losses, Uber reduced 400 jobs in August.
In August, the company reported an unprecedented loss of $5 billion in three months
At the same time, the new regulations threaten to increase the operating costs of the company by changing the payment of fees to drivers.
At the two hour event, Uber did not mention the Assembly Bill 5, a new law passed in September that would change the system of payment of wages and entitlements to Kick economic workers in California, including drivers.
Uber and its competitor Lift and new companies awarding temporary work contracts have announced plans to oppose the legislation through ballot process 2020
With operating system coordinates and Uber Eats changes, Uber has taken a number of security updates to the app.
Passengers will now use a four-digit unique identification number to ensure that they enter the right car.
Uber said it is developing an ultrasound wave technology to identify if the app is in the right car without a private identity number.
In the app, passengers will now have the option to declare a safety event and send information to 911 in case of an emergency.
"" "The company has further updated the" "" "real-time identification test" "" "which was introduced in 2016 to enable drivers to take mobile phones to check their identities." ""
The changes come after a woman, who was sexually assaulted by her driver, filed a $10 million lawsuit in April.
Last week, several women announced that they had filed a case against the lift company for allegedly sexually harassing them by drivers.
The victim, who has filed the case against Uber, accuses the company of failing to warn her of the dangers of her services to women.
Last year, a CNN report said that at least 103 Uber drivers in the US have been accused of sexually assaulting or assaulting their passengers in four years.
Uber also announced that it will expand its Uber reward scheme to convert the points received by customers travelling in Uber vehicles into gifts if ordered by Uber Eats or spent in partner restaurants.
Boris Johnson's tax concessions will cost 26 billion a year
The Institute of Financial Studies (IFS) (IFS) opposed Boris Johnson's key policy
"" "These concessions threaten to" "" "destabilize public finances" "" ""
The Treasury spokesperson said: 'Any decision has to be taken by the President
A leading British economic thinker today warned that the proposed Prime Minister's concessions would cost 26 billion a year and would benefit most of the rich families.
The financial research firm opposed Boris Johnson's key policy of removing the cap on both high rate income tax and national insurance.
It warned that these concessions were 'threatening to destabilize public finances' when there was a risk of leaving the European Union without an agreement
Reflecting the criticism put forward by the opposition, the thinker said that most of the tax concessions will go to the high income group.
During the Tory Party's campaign for leadership, he expects the intervention to put pressure on him to evade his guarantee of tax concessions and get a huge amount of votes if the general elections are announced.
Mr. Johnson had promised to increase the upper rate of income tax in the UK, Wales and Northern Ireland from 50,000 to 80,000.
He said that he wanted to help the 'very large number of middle income families who were forced to pay a higher rate of tax of 40.'
The number of high rate tax payers has doubled from 1.6 million in 1990 to 3.8 million.
If the proposed tax rebate is introduced immediately, the treasury will cost 9 billion per annum and 2.5 million people will leave without paying 40 per cent higher tax.
"This is a substantial and expensive offer, which will benefit only those with higher income." ""
Mr. Johnson has outlined a plan to increase the availability of national insurance to 8,632 now.
The IFS estimated that every 1,000 increase in that limit would cost $4 billion if they were increased simultaneously.
It warned that the increase in all limits to 12,500 to conform to individual income tax allowances would cost 17 billion a year.
The report noted that the poorest 20 per cent of the poor families will get only 3 per cent of the benefits as the highest number of people do not earn or do not have a job to pay national insurance.
The IFS also stressed that if tax concessions are gradually introduced, Mr. Johnson's tax concessions will cost between 10 billion and 20 billion per year.

"Modern animal welfare is to consider how an animal adapts to its living conditions mentally and physically," "ACD City Service Minister Chris Steel, who protected the bill, said in a press release."
Nestle increases restrictions on coffee beans after locust threat
In a statement on Friday, the world's largest coffee company said some of the green coffee beans supplies had the maximum amount of glyphosate residues allowed.
The glyphosate is an important raw material in Monsando's weed runoff.
The US judges ordered that the judges pay the highest amount of monetary compensation to those who claim to have cancer because of the use of glyphosate.
The Monsanto drug owner, Bayer, says that the herb is safe when used properly, as well as the US Environmental Protection Agency says.
Newman Cafe Group, one of the largest coffee businesses in the world, said that glyposate is one of the many items it monitors in its purchase of coffee.
Nestle buys a small amount of its coffee beans from NKG.
A spokesman said that Nestle's strict restrictions cannot say what will be the impact on the NKG company right now.
Nestle's (NSRGF) results of increasing testing are unlikely to affect the international coffee supply chain, a spokesman said.
"This is not a new practice, we are strengthening restrictions," "he told CNN Business."
The tests were conducted even before they were sent from coffee producing countries.
Nestle will start from suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil as these countries are one of the largest producers of coffee in the world.
Our agricultural scientists will work with coffee farmers to help them develop their management habits including proper use of pesticides and other herbicides, the Swiss Institute said.
Nestkafe and Nespresso hold the majority position in Nestle's fermented and liquid beverage industry, which created 21.6 Swiss francs ($21.7 billion) sales in 2018.
Nestle entered into an agreement to sell packed Starbucks coffee and tea around the world.
Can glyphosate cause cancer?
According to EPA, glyphosate is used in more than 100 food crops.
Scientists on the Environmental Advisory Council associated with the organic food industry say that many popular breakfast grains contain more chemicals than are considered safe for children.
However, EPA says that glybosate is not a carcinogen and does not have obvious health risks.
In a report in April, the EPA said that the impact on pollen aggregators and the problem of resistance to pollen is environmental hazards.
But this did not stop us from filing a case against Manzando for having cancer for themselves or their loved ones as it was under round-the-clock medicine.
Earlier this year, a judge ordered Bayer Company to pay $2 billion in compensation to a California couple after they said that they had a liboma of Hodkin within four years of their use of more than three decades at their own place.
He has challenged the decision.
"A 2015 study by the World Health Organization (WHO) for Cancer Research found that glyphosate is" "likely to cause cancer in humans" "based on" "low" "cancer in humans and" "sufficient" "evidence for cancer in animals that are tested." ""
However, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Joint Committee on Food and Agriculture later concluded that there was no possibility of humans at risk of cancer as glyphosate was included in the diet.
Somalia: The President of Somalia places importance on the country's progress at the United Nations, but warns that it will not be easy to eliminate terrorism
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed described Somalia as a 'perfect example of the success of the multilateral system', while acknowledging the need for the support and cooperation of international and regional countries to deal with the threats posed by Al-Shahab, a country in the Kombu region of Africa.
Shri Mohammad said that Somalia's journey towards reconstruction is moving forward, but the impact of global discontent and poverty, inequality and unfair globalization cannot be heard and seen without anyone.
Noting that Somalia played a key role in the socio-economic development of the Kombu region of Africa, he expressed confidence that cooperation between the countries of the region would only strengthen political stability and social and cultural linkages.
He expressed pride that the country is proud of the successful conduct of elections in some of the regional states before the 2021 Presidential and Assembly elections
"While referring to Somalia as a" "historic example of reform, flexibility and commitment to progress and reconstruction," "he warned that despite clear progress, the country has faced many more challenges, first and foremost, security, and that" "everything depends on it." ""
With the help of our international partners, we are trying to free ourselves from the last remaining violent extremism and terrorism, he asserted, adding that the task would not be easy, especially due to the violent, cowardly and opportunistic guerrilla warfare of Al-Shahab.
But with the help of the African Union Mission in Somalia and other partners, Shri Mohammad said that his country will regain stability, which he believes is good for the region and the world.
Talking about climate change, a major issue before member countries, he said Somalia, which has the longest coastline in the African continent, is already experiencing the impact of sea level and rise in temperature.
Somalia was affected by land degradation, prolonged drought and deforestation.
He reiterated his commitment to the Paris Agreement and reiterated his commitment to the Security Council Resolution 751 (1992), which calls upon all countries to take necessary steps to prevent direct, indirect import and export of Somali coal.
It may not protect the environment, but it will certainly ensure that there is no funding for terrorists, he said.
The Super Bowl break show will be hosted by J. Lo and Shakira
Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will be cheering for their fans during the New York (AP) -2020 Pepsi Super Bowl break.
NFL, Pepsi and Rock Nation announced on Thursday that superstar singers, who have been releasing music in Spanish and English since the 1990s, will be singing at the Heart Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, on February 2.
Lobus and Shakeera shared a picture of themselves standing together on social media to announce the news.
"We will see the world playing with enthusiasm," "Lobus wrote."
Theres nothing more than that!
"" "# Super Bowl Live # Pepsi Hofftime! I am excited to be on stage!"
Lobus and Shakira, who have released successful songs and albums over the years, have achieved great success in pop and Latin songs.
"Lobus, who released his most popular debut album in 1999, topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart with songs such as" "If You Have My Love," "" "All I Have," "" "and" "I Am Real" "and" "It's Fanny." ""
Lobus recently travelled on a tour to celebrate his 50th birthday and his latest film Hustlers became a box office hit and earned him the Oscar nomination.
"She released her first album in 1991 and released the album" "Landry Service" "in 2001, which had hit songs like" "Wen Ever, Wer Ever" "and" "Undernest Your Clades." ""
"She topped the Hot 100 chart with" "Hips Dond Lai" "produced with the help of Wycliffe Jean."
She has won 11 Latin Grammy Awards and three Grammy Awards.
"These two popular singers have set an example of what the show will be like, and we hope it will be the best show for many years," "said Todd Cablan, Vice President, Marketing, Pepsi in a statement."
The event is being jointly produced by J-Z-in Rock Nation.
The much awaited competition and break show will be telecast live on Fox TV in 180 days.
Tyrone Kevin Delvin gets 24 suspension
Tyrone selector has been suspended for 24 weeks for behaving as a supporter in a competition for the elderly
The Central Inquiry Committee (CHC) of Crock Park confirmed the proposed dismissal by the Central Competition Control Committee (CCC) following the events during the July 27 match for counties under the age of 15 between the Duron and Town teams.
He was accused by a supporter of 'disruptive behaviour that does not lead to early postponement of a competition.'
Delvin, who works with Tyrone owner Mickey Hart, chose not to accept the punishment proposed by the CCCC to seek an inquiry in the presence of the CHC, which proved the alleged violation.
Delvin now has an option to go to the Central Appellate Committee of the GAA in an attempt to quash his sentence.
Given that the ban on the distribution of CHC findings will begin on Thursday, Delvin will not be able to have any involvement with the Tyrone team until March 2020 Alliance League matches.
Former Tipper Hurler Ian Prisclein 16 has been banned for a week for an incident that took place during the 15-year Araban Harling match against Wexford on August 31.
"Brisbane used bad words towards an arbitrator and as per Rule 7.2 (c) of the official guide, the CCCC has proposed two separate restrictions on" "assault on an arbitrator in some way" ""
Although the second violation was not proved, the CHC confirmed the first violation and imposed a four-week ban.
However, they found that the evidence provided showed a slight violation.
"" "The violation was" "" "low sex with a arbitrator" "," "which was banned for 12 weeks." ""
Like Delve, Prism can also request for his case to be taken before the CAC.
"" "Fed interest rates should be" "" stable, "" "" says Harker. "" "
Patrick Harker, head of the Philadelphia Fed, says that a strong economy with clear negative risks, feels that interest rates should not change as events take place.
In a note to the Open Shadow Market Committee of economists monitoring Fed's activities, he said, My personal view is that without changing interest rates, events should come to an end and see what happens.
Harker, a non-voting member of the Open Provincial Market Committee, said this nine days after his fellow central bankers voted to reduce the interest rate by a quarter, the second reduction this year.
He said the economy is strong with inflation moving towards Fed's target of 2%.
However, he also mentioned possible problems that could lead to 'commercial and international developments and the uncertainty they create.'
Along with his views on rates, Harker had also commented on the short-term debt or repo-induced turmoil last week, leading to a 10% increase in short-term rates and an increase in Fed's financial rates by 5 basis points over its target limit.
While those events are shocking to the markets, they do not reflect or guide the monetary policy stance.
They will not have any impact on the broader economy, he said.
However, Fed further said that his approach towards maintaining his balance sheet should be continued and the 'natural' expansion should be considered.

The main European Championship finals are scheduled to be held at Wembley Stadium on July 12 and players from all 55 UEFA national federations will try to qualify for the final on July 9-10, two days before the end of the tournament in London.

Le Wayne has been ordered to pay more than $150K in the fraud concert case.
About $150,000 has to be paid for creating fraudulent companies to book false concerts, and he is not worried about responding to the case.
The judge had ordered the singer to pay $150K for violating the agreement with investor Ramin Nadan and for fraud, but Justice Nadan issued a favourable order in favour of the side as Wayne did not appear for the case.
"The investor said the case was filed by Nadan in January last year against Lil Wayne and the Hiphop Group Mikos, in which they were" "fraudsters" "and received money for events without a plan to create and run fraudulent companies."
Legal documents show that Nadan said he had lent $500,000 to a person named Eric Stenger to advertise his programmes.
Nadan said that Stanger had been associated with him from the very beginning and had lied that he was an advertiser of concerts.
He said Wein received an investment of $500,000 from him and never held a concert after that and did not return the money.
Legal documents show that Lil Wayne was informed of the case but as he failed to respond, he was given a one-sided judge against Vysi.
Usually, the court will give one last chance for the defendant to respond.
He is 36 years old, facing a series of legal problems, which has been a recent problem.
Earlier this year, his former recording firm Moments in Time had threatened to take legal action against him for trying to auction his old songbook without giving it.
Despite representing Wayne for 13 years, he sued former lawyer Ronald Sweeney for the same amount, claiming that he had cheated him to the tune of 15.2 million.
These issues range from policy discussions to legal challenges in the first settlement, automobile efficiency and housing.
In a letter to Governor Kevin Newson, EBA administrator Andrew Wheeler said that the government and the governors of San Francisco and Los Angeles do not seem to be acting in a hurry to limit public health risks as untreated human waste is mixed with nearby water bodies.
He asked the government to explain how it would respond and 'failed to fulfill its responsibility under the allocated provincial plans'.
San Francisco Mayor London accused Brett Trump of 'criticizing' his city for political reasons without any other reason.
There is no injection from our waste system into the Gulf or the Sea, and there is no connection between homelessness and water quality in San Francisco, he said in a statement.
I would like the President who wants to work with us on the solutions to the challenges we face, whether our infrastructure, our additional housing needs, or the lack of housing. 'Eric Sheffer, Director of the Environment Integration Project and former CEO of the EPA, said,' The current focus on homelessness camps has been misguided as we are unable to control illegal eviction from large sources across the United States.
EIB has found that industrial farms and coal ash wells near power plants are the main sources of water pollution and have not faced EPA implementation.
"Earlier this week, at the United Nations Environment Summit, News said he was" "humiliated" "by Trump's environmental achievement."
Trump said the administration has withdrawn a number of environmental protection measures, from the near-species law to the Obama climate rules, as impediments to economic progress.
During a fundraising visit to California last week, he had threatened to intervene by the provincial government to 'fix the homeless problem there,' and proposed that the EBA should stop wastewater from the San Francisco homeless camp into the Pacific Ocean.
Last week, Trump revoked the centuries-old power of California to set its own emission standards, prompting California Attorney General Sevilla Begera to file a case a few days later, who has sued the administration more than 60 times on various issues.
Zimbabwe: Toxic Doctor Exits the Country for Treatment
A Zimbabwean doctor, who was allegedly kidnapped and tortured for the doctors' strike, left the country on Thursday night for emergency treatment in South Africa, as his medical team said.
Dr. Peter Mahombe, who is in charge of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, had been undergoing treatment in Harare for a week since his release.
His friends and colleagues suspect that he was poisoned when he was smuggled for five days and that he is now suffering from liver disease.
His father has been staying with him at Kingston Macombe Hospital since his release on Thursday.
"I am very happy with the action taken by the doctors, so I am very happy because I think he needs more treatment in some areas," "said Kingston Mahombe."
Peter Mahombe was able to leave for South Africa only after High Court Chief George Siveshi condemned the police for violating the court order and preventing the doctor from leaving.
Zimbabwean Information Minister Monika Matsawanga continues to say that the police intervened in the move to Mahombe for security and health reasons.
Police are actively trying to protect the public by investigating those accused of kidnapping and putting them before justice, Madswanga said.
He was a doctor because he could give important clues to them to carry out their investigation, and he needed the help of the court to delay his departure to South Africa.
It is the duty of the police to protect all its citizens.
According to his association, doctors have not called off their three-week strike after Macombe left Zimbabwe for medical treatment.
His colleagues say that the openly doctor was kidnapped on September 3 for calling for a strike to press Emerson Mangawa to increase the salary of doctors currently less than $200 a month.
