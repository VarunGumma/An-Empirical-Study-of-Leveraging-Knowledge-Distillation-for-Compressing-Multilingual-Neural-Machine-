When a small population (a small population) moves away from large populations (if they pass through a mountain or a river or if they are not able to come back to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different situation than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, therefore, it will require different features or changes to be stronger than required before the new population.
The real population is not always going to change.
In time, the new population changes according to the new environment, and they appear to be different from the rest of the population.
In the end, after thousands or millions of years, both the populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, that is, the creation of a new organism, which is an inevitable consequence of evolution.

Outside the savanna grassland, it is difficult for a human-like animal to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Further, failure can have serious consequences such as depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily obtained plant resources are proteins found in leaves and pulses, but they are non-edible for mammals like ours.
On the contrary, animal feed (ants, rodents, and eggs) are easy to digest, but they are high in protein content with all the amino acids they need.
After considering everything, it is not surprising that our ancestors had solved the problem of protein, just as they do today.
