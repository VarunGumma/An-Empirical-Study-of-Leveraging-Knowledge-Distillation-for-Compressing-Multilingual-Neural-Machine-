Hersh and Chase experiments were one of the early indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Harsh and Chase used phages or viruses to infect their own DNA in bacteria.
He did two experiments, one with a radioactive phosphorous of the DNA in the phages or with the protein of the phages with radioactive sulphur.
The type of mutation, the type of the genetic component on which it has occurred, and the cell on which the cells that have been affected are or not, can have many different effects of mutation.
In children, only new cells can be altered, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.

Every morning, people go to their small native villages to go to work and pass on by other people, whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic traffic shuttle, everyone is connected and supporting a personal car based transport system.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has changed the stable state of the organism that has been supporting human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in the society and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, we rarely hear such complaints about water quality or bridges.
Why does the transport system encourage such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are only the transport engineers inefficient? or is the design going on to go on?
The flow of traffic is the study of the individual drivers in 2 points and the movement of vehicles and the interaction they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow as the driver is not able to predict the behavior by 1%.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is similar to that of the same proportion as that of the traffic on the road.
In order to better show the flow of traffic, the following three main features: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, design and operation of road connectivity.
The insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and get more effectively food and joints.
