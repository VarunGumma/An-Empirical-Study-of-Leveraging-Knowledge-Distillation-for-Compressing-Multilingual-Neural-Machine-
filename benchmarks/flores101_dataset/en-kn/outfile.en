The 35mm variant is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm 24mm.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format is said to be 3: 2.
Many common forms (APS series) are equal to or estimated to this size ratio.

For example, cars and cars are the main reasons for the development of roads.

It is very difficult for a primate to meet the amino-acid requirements from the available plant resources on sawana.
In addition, failure to do so can have serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and finally death.
Proteins are easy to obtain from cereals and fruits, but are difficult to absorb them, except for those that are not cooked.
Unlike this, animal feed (rats, mice, and eggs) are not easily digestible, but they provide a large number of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
After considering everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors had solved their protein problem in a way that of chimpanzee.

As the Greeks lost their knowledge, the Westerners separated themselves from the scientific and philosophy of the Greeks.
In physiology and behavior, as noted by many, some of the solutions are found, particularly in the presence of the endogenic cycles and biological clocks.
For most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, the sprouts are not only in response to external periodic instructions but also recorded.
The biological clock is a self-reliant movement. even if there are no external rampup, the biological clock will continue for the cycle period of free motion.
The experiment of herb and lead, DNA, is an important experiment that indicates that it is a genetic material.
Hersh and Chase used bacteria or viruses to inject their own DNA into a bacteria.
They experimented with the marking of DNA using radioactive pigment to do so in the bacterium or with two types of radioactive sulphur in the protein of the faze.
According to the mutation, mutations have different effects depending on the importance of the genetic material and the microbial cells.
The mutation in germ-line cells can only be transferred to the children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cancer or cell death.
